52 INTRODUCTION

a monosyllable which does not bear ictus. The criterion‚
however, is properly pronunciation, not metre ; and, to take
but one case, an emphatic tu such as occurs in 379 οι· 513
would be but little slurred in conversation, and therefore could
surely have been permitted by Plautus to stand in hiatus, even
though lacking ictus. Indeed, the ordinary Plautine usage
seems to be that a inonosyllable standing in hiatus bears, or
does not bear, ictus according to the natural accentuation of
the word-group in which it occurs. It is evident, then, that
he follows conversational usage.¹

(b) ending in -m following a vowel (chiefly iam, nam, num,
dum, cum, and parts of qui), such monosyllables being treated
as short: as,

(i) when the unelided syllable bears ictus: 194—5 z‘di‘m

cf. 695.

(ii) when the unelided syllable does not bear ictus: 292
mim qucrldenz, cf. 82 3 227 qudm {qubm ἐχ Ι, cf. 446 3 675 mfflgi’
qudm Ι adulti, cf. 497 3 737 {td Ι νῖνη e‘'s{se, cf. 453. Instances
falling under this head have suffered emendation, but unneces-
sarily3 see a. (ii) above.

B. Hiatus is sometimes allowed after certain disyllabic
words, namely, (a) words normally scanned according to
necessity as iambi or 'pyrrhics (especially milti, libi‘, srbff, ἔὲῧ,
baffi), such words when they occur in hiatus being scanned as
pyrrhics, e. g.

(i) when ictus falls on the first syllable osttbe word: 840
φηΐῐιῖ ἐκ Ι o‘ralcl03 827 tr'bi auti, cf. 3893 719 no‘n &gb Ι istae'c3

¹ Oeeasionally Augustan poets reveit to the natural usage, as Verg. Ecl.
viii. 108 ant qm ἄηιὶαηί, Cat. xcvii. 1 zta Ι m& αἰ ἄπιΙέηί. Note that in both
instances the unelided syllable bears no ictus. Similar phrases'-1n Plautus
(as Men.194-5 nam 52 “dmIdbas) should be similarly scanned.
