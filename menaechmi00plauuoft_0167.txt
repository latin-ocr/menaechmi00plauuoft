COMMENTARY: LINES 590—611

mane . . . potius z still aside; manc = ‘just you wait Ξ ’

604. ne: particle of asseverantem osten joined with ‹·‹l‹'p‹›l
(ef. 160), or, il' a woman is speaking, with ecastor (cs. 614). Scan
n? Illam elcastorq there is hiatus at the diaeresis alsa

illam = pallam. Matrona now conl'ronts her husband.

Ι faenerato apstulisti, ‘you've stolen it at interest ', i.e. ‘ you
wrll pay dearly for stealing it ’; cs. Assa. 902 ne illa ecastor
faenerato fundital.

sic datur: either ⁴ that's a good stroke ', ‘ one for him ' ;
or, taking do in this and similar phrases as having the meaning os
-do (= τίθημι) in the compounds abdo, δια, ‘ that’s the way to do
it’, ‘that's your style ¹. ln any case it expresses malicious satis—
faction ; cf. 628, and see note on 472 opserua quid dabo. Cf. also
Pseud. 155 ; Τ ruc. 634; Stich. 766.

On the ground that the original order has been considerably dis-
arranged by the copyists, Wagner reshuffles ll. 604—40 in an
arbitrary manner and totally without warrant. The result is a
jplmble sar less intelligible than the conversation as given by
t e MSS.

605. pote: se. esse (= posse): cf. Epid. 227 negant pendi potis
(or pote). where, as here, the MSS. read potesse.

606. Menaechmus, thus taken by surprise, adopts a tone of
innocent sympathy.' Not realizing that he has been overheard, or
that he has a double whose actions have brought upon him the
wrath of his parasite, he has no inkling of the coming storm.

uin hunc rogem? Men. says this in a conciliatory tone,
as not wishing to trouble her ; hence her answer.

607. perge tu ε Pen. eggs on the wife, as below, 611.

609. quidam pallam—abstulit she is going to say, when Pen.
interrupts her with a remark addressed to Men., who shows alarm
at the mentiones the palla. The use of quidam implies that the
culprit is known.

quid paues? masks were not introduced on the Roman stage
until the time of the great actor Roscius, a contemporary os Cicero ;
before his tirne wigs and paint were used. The actor representing
Menaechmus would here express alarin and perplexity by grimaces.
See Introd. .

610. nisi 5². . incutit: some edd. assign these words to Men.
as an ‘aside ' ; but the next line is thus rendered pointless. Possi-
bly Men. may have added them in a low tone intended for Peniculus's
ear alone.

palla pauorem : play upon words. Warner, rendering quid
panes? ‘Why do ye blush ? ’‚ translates here: ¹ He cannot cloake
his blushin ’.

611. at (ει-ε ‘ well ') refers to Men.'s look of surprise when he
realizes that Pen. is against him. The word justifies assigning the
latter part of 610 to Pen.
