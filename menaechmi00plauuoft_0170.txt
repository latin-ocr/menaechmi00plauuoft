it, scan Z'am z‘josffis Ι ΐ 775ch Ι qui'd lch (Ἦ ; in the latter case cf. for
the order Ter. Ad. 917 illas abiet traduce. (Or perhaps in both
cases scan first foot by synizesis eam zpsus.)

639. quasi tu nescias : sc. rogam but see next note.

639³. This line is an anticipation of 645 (where the MSS. reading
is, as here, surrupta est tibz'3 see note there). Its presence here is
probably due to the error of a copyist, whose eye glanced from
nescias 638 to scias 644 with the result that 640-41 were omitted in
his copy. When the error was corrected, instead os 64ο-4 being
replaced aster 639, 640-5 were replaced after 639³. There is no
need to suppose that 639a has usurped the place of an original line
now lost3 if it is omitted, Matrona’s speech runs quasi tu nescias
me rogas ? (indignant question), while the actual disclosure of the
ofsence is thus artistically postponed a little longer.

640. Scan ὅ ΙιόυῑῖηΙευι; hiatus is usual after interjections ending
with a vowel; Introd. 7. IV. D. a. i. For exclamatory accus. cf.
Bacch. 7 59 0 imperatorem probum ,Ι M ost. 1071 o mortalem malum ,Ι

641. non potes, &c.: addressed to Men¹

642. nil pudet: sc. te; in O.Lat. pudet and other impersonal
verbs (as paenitet, oportet) were sometimes used personally, the
subject being a neut. pronoun or pronominal word, or n. pl. adj.;
cf. Epz'd. 107 idne pudet te . . . 52 Ter. Ad. 754 non te lzacc pudent ?
lt is, however, possible here to take m'l as adverbial accus.

643. tu-at uoluntate = sponte lucz.

pr5fiteri : first syllable long ; but cf. Capt. 480 profitetur.
So Plautus varies between proficiscor and proficiscor (e. g. Trz'n.
149 profecturus). Profiteor is used of voluntary confession.

ades: sc. animo, ‘attend’3 cf. llserc. 568 prius lzoc ausculta
atque ades.

645. surruptast mihi? Men. cunningly pretends chagrin at
the loss ; what has been stolen from his better half has been
stolen from himself as paterfizmilias. MSS. have tibi (cf. 639³),
evidently the correction of some dull copyist, rendering the next line
pointless; milzz' is restored by an unnamed scholar quoted by
Lambinus. .

646. uiden ut. . . captat ἱ) addressedto Matrona ; the rest of the
speech is addressed to Men.

captat, ‘tries to take you in ³, i. e. by a sophistry; so in
Amph. 422, 795.

647. salua non foret : i. e. as it now is safe (apud phrygionem).
Camerarius's alteration of non to nunc spoils the senseN

648. nil . . . est: haughtily‚ to Pen. (cf. 323).

sed . . . ais? with polite interest, to his wife; cf. 626-7.
periit: used as passive osperd03 cf. 665 perdam.

649. N ote ille emphatic, with first syllable long and bearing strong
ictus )( illam unaccented.

650. quis is homo est? MSS. have llic for is, contraryto usage (cf.
