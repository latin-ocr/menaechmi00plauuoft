1098 (but see note ad loa), ¹123 3 occurring at diaeresis, as in
431 ³3 or at caesura, as in 544, 546,³ 882.

(d) At a pause in delivery for some dramatic purpose3 e. g.
188 seim ῖιίνῧ Ι-Ιιάηῑ nocltem siles (introducing comic παρὰ προσ-
δοκίαν); 508⁴ (to express assumed indignation); cf. 563, which
might be printed pallam ad phrygionem—cum cordluci--fblriusss ; ¹

ness ³) 3 1088 numquam l m'di l dlterlum (to emphasize surprise) ;

or to emphasize the catastrophic disclosure) 3 1158s25ndz Ι ae‘des
(in a list of separate items given in imitation of a praeco: but
see note ad loa). The series of hiatuses in 720, 737 (two),
739, 740 (two), probably marks sobs 3 see C. b. ii above.

E. In some cases hiatus may be due, partly or entirely, to
the influence on pronunciation of the lost ablative-ending -d.

(a) In the case of me and te the old pronunciation still
lingered on in Plautus’s time 3 accordingly hiatus frequently
occurs after them in his plays, though chiefly at a break in
metre or sense (many instances have been noted under C and
D) 3 when hiatus follows them elsewhere, me, te are printed
med, led in the present text. The accusatives of these
pronouns are by false analogy treated in the same way.

(b) Other instances are 9 1 (at caesura) ; 526 pdnldo' inficiam (an
old commercial phrase; see note ad loc.) 3 563 (see D. d above) 3
882 ⁴ lumbi l sede'nldci ὅίᾶξίί specltando Ι dolent (see D. c. ii) ; 395
rI'tz‘c 1 cistarum 495 lzomilm' igm‘1l0' fnlsciens3 1115 a l patrici l
c'z‘uelclit 3 1151 nffi'strci l ἐχ ςενηίεηῖιῙα. The last four instances
are doubtful, especially 495: see notes ad loc. Probably the
influence of the lost -d was not alone sufficient tofl'ustify hiatus,

¹ Such hiatus' is not infrequently allowed by Augustan poets, even where
the break occurs merely bet veen separate clauses of a sentence; e. g. Verg.
Ecl. ii. 53, viii. 41, x. 133 Georg. i. 4; Aen. iii. 606.

²This disputed hiatus ιε attested by a consensus of. A and Ρ
