58 INTRODUCTION

see notes ad loc. It may bc added that all cases of hiatus
which Prof. Lindsay regards as doubtful are in the present text
marked by a perpendicular line following the unelided syllable;
but for many of these instances explanations have been
attempted in the preceding sections. Possibly the non-con-
sonantal pronunciation of final -m was more general than is
usually supposed.

8. SOURCEs or THE 'l'Ex‘r

The sources that we possess for the text of the Menaechmi
are as follow :

(1) The codex Ambrosianus (A), a MS. of the fourth century
A.D. written in capitals‚ now in the Ambrosian Library at Milan.
It is unfortunately a palimpsest‚ the original text having been
obliterated, and a part of the Vulgate superimposed thereon,
by a too zealous monk of the seventh century. Cardinal Mai,
who discovered the MS. early last century, partially recovered the
original script by the aid of chemicals, which, however, subse-
quently caused parts of the MS. to rot away. Between philistine
monk and scholarly prelate this valuable MS„ once containing
the whole of Plautus, has suffered so severely that about a third
of it only now remains, and that very hard to decipher. Of
this play nearly two-thirds is either missing or totally undeci-
pherable, namely, ll. 1-56‚ 126—58, 303—42, 346-56, 374—445‚
508-10, 595—1005, and 1066-1131. Of the remaining 470
odd verses about a quarter are fairly complete3 the rest show
either beginnings or ends (the central portions of the pages
having suffered the most), or merely faint traces of letters or
words. -Χ

Palatine group, from their original home) are derived from a
common archetype, which was a minuscule MS. of the eighth
or ninth century. The readings of this MS„ inferred from
