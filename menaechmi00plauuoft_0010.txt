Ρ Κ Ρ, FACE

ΙΝ pre-paring this edition os the anamulata· I have derived
much assistance from Brix's fifth edition, revised by Niemeyer,
and have found Hildyard's edition, though antiquated‚ not
without value. Among other authorities consulted I may
mention Lindsay’s Latin Language and syntax of Plautum
contributions to the Journal of l’lu'lology and other periodicals
by Lindsay, Onions‚ and Sonnenschein3 Havet’s Observatz'ons
sur plaute in the Revue de Plcz‘lologie (1908) 3 Sonnenschein’s
Rudens ς Lindsay’s Captivi3 and Gray's Asinaria.

My best thanks for valuable corrections and suggestions are
due to Mr. H. W. Garrod, who read this work in manuscript 3
to Mr. C. E. Freeman, who read it in proofg and to the
Reader to the Clarendon Press. The text and apparatus
criticus are by permission taken from the edition of Professor
Lindsay in the Scriptorum Classl'corum Bibliotheca Oxonienszk.

It is hoped that the Index to the Notes may prove of some
slight value to scholars.

P. T. J.
