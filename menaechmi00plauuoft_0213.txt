COMMENTARY: LINES 1135—55

¹¹⁴7- sac ε sc. ut liber sit.

1148. liber esto: cf. 1029, 1093. Manumission os a slave at
Rome was effected by one os two methods: by a formal ceremony
in the praetor's court, which consisted of the owner's striking the
slave with a m'ndista (liberating rod), turning him round, and then
dismissing him with the words liber esto (cf. Pers. Sat. ν. 75 una
Quiritem uertigo saed,- ibid. 78 uerterit hunc dominus, momento
turbinis exit Alanus Danum or, as here, by an informal pro-
nouncement of the formula liber esto in the presence os a witness;
cf. Ter. Ad. 970.

quom tu es, &ca Men. 1 jokingly congratulates Messenio in
the very terms in which the latter had, in his presence, imagined
his sellow -slaves to be addressing him, 1031- -.2 At the same time,
congratulations to a newly emancipated slave w ere usually expressed
in this sormula; cf. its ironical use Epm'. 711. On this use ofquom
(= quod) see 1031— 2, note.

1149-50. meliorest . . . auspicio: he means either (1) that as
he has already been deluded by an informal manumission (1029),
he would this time like one ‘under better auspices’, i. e. carried
out formally before the praetor, which it would be impossible to
revoke; or (2) that the gift of freedom without a more material
gift would not carry with it certainty of freedom sor ever (e. g. he
might fall into debt, and become the bond-slave of his creditor);
he wishes for some ‘still better luck' to enable him to keep up
his new dignity ε this wish he obtains, 1155. For similar requests
cf. Epid. 727 nouo liberto opus est quod pappet ; Ter. Ad. 980—2.
Probably Messenio speaks this line aside, as the next lines contain
no reference to it; when a suitable opportunity occurs he prefers
a definite request openly, 1154-5.

1151. nostra ex: the hiatus may perhaps be due to the dis-
appearance os the abl.-ending -d ; but see App. Crit. Brix suggests
εῖτ nmini, which gives a bad rhythm-

1153. auctionem: cf. Pom. 1421, where Agorastocles sells his
property by auction before departing for Carthage with Hanno. In
classica! prose the phrase sor holding an auction is sub hasta
uendere.

quidquid est: sc. mi‘lcz.
1154. e—amus intro: into which house? See 963—4.
frater ε see App. Crit. here ancl 1152. The repetition of frater
is natural under the circumstances3 it occurs six times between
1133 and this line.
scitin τ to draw attention.

1155. praeconium, ‘the job of auctioneer’. Praecanes were of „

two kinds: public praecones appointed publicly to conduct auctions
of state property, booty‚ &c.; and private (prosessional) praecones,
who combined the callings os crier (equivalent to modern bill-
sticker; cf. 46) and auctioneer: the latter gave public notice of
