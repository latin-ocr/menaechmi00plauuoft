E. One or two more peculiarities of Plautine scansion, and
a few particular cases, may be given a place under the head of
Shortening :

(a) Plautus never, like later poetS, avoids leaving a final
short vowel before words beginning with such combinations
as sc, sm, sp, sq, sl.

(b) Plautus never lengthens a short vowel before a combina-
tion of mute and liquid in the same word (e. g. patria, agros
always have first syllable short). The scansion of quf' 7ch lelgi's
580 may be an extension of this rule, but the shortening of net
is probably due to its position between two accented syllables
both long.

(c) The shortening of long final vowels where hiatus occurs
(e. g. td JSJIc) is illustrated under the heading ffl'atus (see
below, IV. A. a).

(d) A few cases of apparent shortening do not sall under any
of the rules given above. In some instances shortening may

be due to final -m losing its consonantal power (i. e. merely
nasalizing the preceding vowel), e. g. 592 dz-'xffrdm Ι ίόηίνοιτιον-
silam, 916 prr-''mztlffm ,lqm'n3 both these lines, however, are
probably corrupt3 see notes ad loc. Some cases need the
application of surgery 3 e. g. in 39 Tc‘irffnltz'dslse is an impossible
scansion, though it may, as occurring in the Prologue, be

an erroneous imitation of Plautine prosody. Ὗ

The same practical result as is obtained by the shortening
of long syllables under certain circumstances is procured in
