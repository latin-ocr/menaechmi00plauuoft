COMMENTARY: 1.1N1·:s 446—72

459. contioni . . . comitieis: a fontia was a non-voting assem-
bly convened by a magistrate when he wished to inform the {imple
on some point; comitia were voting assemblies held for elections,
trials, or legislation.

460. Scan εἴ {d Ηας see {nn-od. 7. lv. A. a. i. and cf.751 κί’ amm,
815-16 st' ega.

461. datum uoluisse: supply enm ui. e. Allcnacclmmm) as subject
to datum (soprandium') uoluisse; for the omission cf. 347 ; ‘ tl) to
whom 1 am as sure that he would not have grudged it as that 1 am
alive '. The combination of uela with a past participle to signif)-
desire (cf. 1120) or (as here) acquiescence is a classical use. For
tam . . . quam with verbs cf. Ter. Eun. 718 Parmenonis lam scin
esse hanc techinam quam me uiuere. Scan dalfz‘im ιηῖίιῖ fisse, which
forms a word-group like voluptas-anea οι· coctum-dabo, and is
accented as a polysyllable.

462. etiamnum = etiam nunc.

463. cum corona: Greeks and Romans put on garlands when
dessert appeared; they believed that alcoholic fumes were so
prevented from rising too high. Pen. knows from this sign that
sublatum est conuiuium.

464. sublatum est z he has no hope even of the reliquiae.

uenio aduersum: sarcastic; cf. 437.

465. hominem: here the ‘anticipatory’ accusative follows the
dependent clause.

466. Menaechmus II is speaking to Erotium within as lie eomes
out of her house ; he is tired of her reiterated instructions.

potine ut = petisne es ut, i. e. potesne facere ut. Cf. 627 ; l’crs.
175 polin ut taceas? potin ne moneas ? So Poen. 916.
hanc ε the palla.
463. non with eam (= eandem).
{ta 'iglnorabitun ‘it will be so well disguised’; cf. 428.

469. Peniculus hears these loudly-spoken words ‹466-83, but
when Men. moves away across the stage ancl talks to himself
(473-7, 480—5) he can hear only a few words. See Introd. 4, p. 17.

471. Pen. felt bound to avenge such treatment in the interests
of his profession. Hiatus is perhaps possible after a monosyllable
without ictus; cf. 379 note. But rhythm will coincide with accent
if we scan non herlcl? i‘s ¹ snm qui' ¹ sum : for this hiatus cf. 316.
See also App. Crit.

472. opserua quid dabo, ‘ wait and see how I’ll pay him out
(give him what for)' : or, if we are to accept Langen’s explanation
that in this and similar phrases do has the meaning of -do ( = τίθημι)
in the compounds condo, abdo, &c., ‘ wait and see what 1’11 do ’.
Cf. Pers. 29² specta quid dedero; Ter. Phor-m. 1027 sic attha.
These phrases, used as threats, are to be distinguished from the
expression of satisfaction (generally malicious) sic datur; see note
on 604, and cf. 628. Sic dedero is used in both ways; contrast
