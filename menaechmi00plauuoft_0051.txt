certain other cases by Synizesis‚¹ a process by which two
or more separate successive vowel-sounds are sused into one
syllable (as in the Cockney pronunciation of now. aut, ἃς.)
That synizesis, as occurring in the plays of Plautus and
Terence, reproduces a peculiarity of pronunciati0n‚ is evident
from two considerations: (i) they allow it only in a limitcd
number of words and inflexions of words: (ii) examination
of instances will show that, in words liable to contractiori by
synizesis‚ the accent falls, as a mle, in the uncontracted word,
on one or other of the successive vowel-sounds, and is therefore
borne, in the contracted word, by the syllable resulting from
vowel-fusion 3 that in the majority of cases metrical ictus also
falls on the contracted syllable 3 and that, when it does not, an
explanation ean be found in the incidence of sentence-accent
(see above, pp. 38-40).

In this play synizesis occurs in the following classes of words :

(a) Cases of is and idem, and genitives of qui, quis, and lu‘c ² :
as (i. bearing ictus) 35 &iqua 892 ἒῗὶ Ι te camlsa, cf. 10603
4²4 eam nollo, cf. 4973 428 Z'Edem3 221 qfflsmo'dz', cf. 577 ;

(b) Cases of meus, tuos, suos : as (i) 81 υιέἃ, cs. 200, 783, 905,

p. 39) 3 1028 sJ' tic-om l ηὲξςᾶς (perhaps a case of Ι. Β. b. i).

(0) Cases of deus„ dies, and a few similar nouns: (i) 812

second syllable when the -que is elided 3 contrast 811-12);
possibly 588 cll-ens qmffdam (more probably a case of I. B. b. i).

¹ Synizesis occurs not infrequently in the works of the Augustan poets.
² In the present text eius, quoius, huius, quoi are so printed when¹ they
suffer synizesis; otherwise they are printed eiius, quoiins, lruiius, quon.
