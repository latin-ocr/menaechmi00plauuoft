COMMENTARY: LINES 882-902

aqua intercus (i. e. inter cutem), ‘(lropsy'. warner, ‹lis-
.placing the order, translates 890-1: ‘Is it a letarge or a lunacie,
or melancholie‚ or dropsie ?’

894. mea . . . fide, ‘on my honour'. Such promises are part
of the quack's stock-in-trade.

895. The Senex does not like the doctor‘s airy perfacile: lie
wants to be sure that great pains will be taken. The doctor
therefore rushes to the other extreme, 896.

896. Both the reading and the interpretation of this line are
questions of great difficulty. (ι) Niem. retains sescenta, taking it
as agreeing with suspiria understood (cognate acc.); he also
adopts an arrangement suggested by Lindsay‚ and transfers ita
(897) to the end of this line, reading at the beginning of 897 ega
illum latter word as in MSS). He scans thus: in tiras: 127ιῖ Η
ego Illum. This will give the sense : ‘ Why, then, l'll heave scores
of (painful) sighs each day, such great pains l’ll spend you over his
treatment '. For in dies distributive cf. 457 ; sescenti is the usual
expression for a vaguely large number. (2) Ritschl arranges
894-6 thus: 896, 895, 894. In this line, embodying suggestions of
Scaliger (sospitabo) and Camerarius (sescentos), he reads quin
sospitabo plus sescentos in die, ‘ why, I’ll cure six hundred (such)
a day ⁹, which thus continues the casual tone osperfacile id quidemst.
This gives good sense, but shows little regard sor the MSS.
(3) Palmer, in an Appendix to his edition of Amphitruo (p. 253),
suggests keeping Ritschl‘s order, and reading quin subus piabo
plus sescentis in dies (referring to expiation by sacrifice of swine) ;
but (a) the swine had to be ten days old, not sues ( = full grown
swine); cf. note on 2903 (b) this reading would render 895 (the
next line according to Ritschl’s arrangement) pointless; (c) the
religious.act had to be performed by the patient, and is to be
distinguished from the medical treatment by hellebore; cf. 913,
950; Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 164-6. (4) Lindsay's suggestion sescenta
sexies (a comic exaggeration of sescenta, to be taken as (1) above)
is a likely solution ; see App. Crit. sor source of error.

897. tibi: ethic dative.

899. peruorsus: lit. ‘ wrong way round’ ; everything has turned
out exactly contrary to his wishes; the day has ‘gone awry‘. Cf.
Cicero’s word-play, pro Cluent. 26. 71 ut erat semper praeposterus
atque peruorsus, initium facil a Bulbo.

901. flagiti, ‘disgrace’; for genitive after compounds os -pleo
cf. Aul. 4543 Amph. 470; the ablative is more usual; cf. Cisl. 127
me compleuiflore Lz'berz·; Cas. 123 ; Merc. 795.

902. meus Vlixes: the parasite is compared to Ulysses as
being a cunning accomplice in rascality; perhaps there is also
a reference to the estrangement between Agamemnon and his wife,
and Ulysses’ services to the former in the matter of the sacrifice
of Iphigenia (cf. Eur. l. in A. 524, 1361).
