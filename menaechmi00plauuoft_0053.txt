have been doubted, they present no real difficulty. 'l‘he Indo-
European comparative suffix-stem was -1'ycins-, which gave rise
to Greek -ιων- (shortened to -ιον- in all cases but noui. sing. ιιι.
and f.) and Latin -ίᾱς- (= -1'0n5-l. The latter became -ίῡν- ἰη

finally weakened to -ibr, -ιίἷς,

further cases, namely, 841 lampadissbds stridentibus, 887 dufcl-re‘l

1V. Hiatus.

With regard to the ‘permission of hiatus’² by the comic
dramatists, three facts should be clearly realized: first, many
phrases found in Plautus and Terence in which hiatus occurs
are common phrases of every-day life reproduced with their
ordinary pronunciation 3 secondly, a final syllable capable of
elision, if for any reason a distinct pause occurred after it,
would in· conversation (as in the comic drama) normally retain
its full value before an initial vowel-sound. Thirdly and
especially, the dffserence, in respect of permission of hiatus,²
between the comic dramatists and the Augustan poets was one
of metrical treatment only, not of pronunciation. To put it
more clearly : in reading such a passage of Vergil as

Aenean fundantem arces ac tecta nouantem
Conspicit ; atque illi stellatus iaspide fulua
Ensis erat, Tyrioque ardebat murice laena
Demissa ex umeris . . .

an educated Roman would not have been guilty of emitting

¹ The instance in 841 may be justified by Vergil, Aen. iv. 64 pictorilbi's
snfft'llefffiss. phrase is used sor convenience’ sake in place os some such correct
but clumsy expression as: retention os metrical value, wholly or partially,
by syllables capable of elision but not elided before initial vowel or h.
