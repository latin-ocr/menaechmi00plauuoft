PROSODY ,ς ι

inserted from the fact that the original long quantity of the
verb-terminations -1't, -et, of the noun-termination -ον, and of the
comparative endings, -or, -us (to give a few instances) is
occasionally reproduced by Plautus.

IV. With regard to the much-discussed question os hiatus it
is more difficult to find a basis for Plautine usage in popular
speech. It rnay, however, be conjectured that, while as a
general rule a final vowel or vowel ÷ m was slurred in speech
before a following initial vowel, yet in certain combinations
and word-groups such final syllables retained part of their
value ς and that Plautus’s treatment of certain constantly
recurring phrases showing hiatus,¹ such as ειῖ he'rcle, eti depol,
tti' Istic, si cimas, afim ἕο, daim ἔα, flagitium Ιιὸηιίηιζς, &C.‚ exactly
reproduces their popular pronunciation.² Again, by the law of
inertia the influence of the original final —d of the ablative must
have still affected speech for some time after the -d had ceased
to be actually pronounced.³ Lastly‚ in ordinary conversation
a final vowel or vowel -ι- m, normally slurred before a following
initial vowel, would naturally retain its full value if a pause of
any kind occurred before the ensuing word.⁴ The fact that
Plautus allows hiatus in certain combinations, avoids it in
others, and in others again uses hiatus or elision indiscrimi-
nately, would probably admit of easy explanation if we had
a complete knowledge of the laws of Latin pronunciation.

It remains to give instances collected from this play of those
peculiarities of Plautine prosody which reproduce the features
of ordinary pronunciation as enumerated above. The sections
which follow are numbered and lettered to correspond with the
summary given in the preceding paragraphs, to which reference
should be made when necessary. In accordance with the
general practice the position of the metrical ictus is indicated

¹ See IV. A, B, D (a), F, below.

² This supposition is strenglhened by the existence of such compounds
as werra, damno, circz'imago. circsieo, prdln'heo, &c.

³ See lV. E, below. ⁴ See IV. C, D, below.
