THE STAGING OF THE l'LAY ¹9

carried an oil-flask and strigil. Slaves were distinguished by
red wigs; old men by white wigs (cf. 854), long white beards
(cf. 838 hircus, 854), and walking-stlcks (cf. 856). Respectable
women wore pallae of plain material, white or dark-blue or
green according to age, while courtesans were dressed in smart
red or yellow tunics and white or yellow pallae with plenty of
trimming (cf. 427 note), and in some cases wore still more
elaborate attire‚ or appeared in an elegant deichaht'lle‘(cf. Alost.
²48 seq.). Wigs and paint alone served sor facial disguise‚
masks not being used on the Roman public stage until after
the time of Terence (cf. 609 note). ⁴

The division of plays by Plautus and Terence into Acts
dates from the Renaissance. The Roman dramatist had per-
force to observe the ‘ Unity of Time ’, and was careful to avoid
pauses in the act10n; theatre-bars had not yet been thought of,
and if any long wait had occurred, the actors would have been
faced by empty benches on their reappearance. W here a short
pause is unavoidable‚ as at Pseud. 573, an apology is made,
and the interval filled with a selection of music. At the same
time, owing to the exigencies of the plot, occasions would arise
when the stage was momentarily empty 3 and in the *Menaechmi
at least the Renaissance editor has happily fixed the divisions
between the Acts at the only four points where this occurs.
Division into Scenes was of earlier date, and is a feature of all
MSS. of Plautus and Terence 3 but here again the divisions do
not correspond to any actual break, the exit of a character or
entrance of a new speaker being sufficient to mark a change of
Scene, which did not therefore involve change of scenery.
Accordingly in some MSS. each ‘Scene’ bears as a heading
the names of the characters taking part in it. It may be noted
that in this play, instead of the existing breaks between Scenes
at 875 and 888, there should be but a single break, namely‚
at 881.

On the other hand, Roman comedies fall into certain
