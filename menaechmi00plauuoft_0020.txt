16 INTRODUCTION

social customs are mentioned in 437, 445, διε. (aduersarer),
¹153 (auction), 160 (circus-games), 210-11 (Roman fondness
for pork). Other features for which Plautus is responsible are
puns such as those on geminus and gemere 2 57, on Epidamnus
263—7‚ on uerba and uerbera 978, on mblftum and moYitum 979,
palla pallorem incutit 6 10 3 and comic Latin nicknames, such as
Peniculus (cf. 77—8‚ 286, 39¹)-

At the same time Plautus's title to originality does not
rest merely upon such features and allusions as have been
specified. To Terence, who however excellent a translator
was little more, he offers a distinct contrast 3 and in dramatic
instinct, spontaneity of humour, and power of characterization
he may be regarded as the prototype of his far greater successor,
our own-in spite of German claims-—still Britisb Shakespeare,
whose plays, like those of Plautus, were original in all but plot.

4. THE STAGING OF THE PLAxr

In Plautus⁷s day the theatrical profession existed only on
sufferance. No permanent theatre was built until 55 B.c.‚
before which date dramatic representations took place on
temporary stages of wood before audiences that had to
bring their own chairs. While the general plan of the Roman
theatre temporary or permanent, followed Greek models, the
space occupied in the Greek theatre by the ὀρχήστρα (which
formed a segment of a circle greater than a semicircle, and
in which the chorus danced and sang> was in the Roman
theatre reduced to an exact semicircle of which the front of
the stage formed the diameter 3 and, in the absence of a chorus,
this space was reserved (by law after 194 B.C.) for the senators,
thus roughly corresponding to the stalls of anQdern theatre.
Round the edge of this semicircle, in the later permanent
theatres, rose tiers of seats with gangways running down at
intervals ,- in earlier times ground forming a natural amphi-
theatre was chosen for the site of a temporary theatre, and the
