PRosoov 37

Plautine prosody is summed up in the so-called Law of Breves
Breviantes, which is thus enunciated by Sonnenschein: ‘ A
long syllable may be treated as short when it is both preceded
by a short syllable and either preceded or followed by an ictus.'

Recent investigations tend to show that both the name——
‘ Short (syllables) Making (others) Short ’—and the wording of
this Law are misleading: that aecem, rather than either ictus
or the presence of a preceding short syllable, was primarily the
determining cause of shortening. And indeed, it was the chief
and perhaps the only serious fault of Ritschl's immediate fol-
lowers that they attributed too much influence to ictus. F urther
investigators in the same field, among whom Seyffert, Stude-
mund, and Lindsay¹ hold a foremost place, have demonstrated
that in the verse of Plautus accent plays a far more important
part than ictus in the determination of quantity; that, owing to
Plautus’s skill in arrangement, accented syllables are, as a general
rule, placed in those parts of the line which receive ictus ² 3 and
that the apparent exceptions to this rule admit, in a large
number of cases, of clear and convincing explanation.

Their explanations may be roughly summarized as follows.
In ordinary Latin speech of the classical era words received
their accents according to a principle known as the Penultima
Law, by which disyllables were accented on the penultimate,
polysyllables on the penultimate or the ante-penultimate
according as the penultimate was long or short.³ In the verse
of Plautus apparent conflict between accent and ictus occurs
most frequently (1) in certain words of more} than three
syllables where ictus falls on the first syllable 3 (2) in words
where ictus falls on the last syllable.⁴ Exceptions of the first

¹ See Lindsay's articles in the Journal qs Plzz'lology, vols. xx-xxst, xxvii;
and his edition of the Captiui (Methuen).
² Or, to put it differently, ictus usually falls on accented syllables.
¹³ Words of more than three syllables have also a seeondary inferior
aecem, as Mercurius, flagitium, anerdriae, tempestatibus (ef. in Eng.
multitudinous).
⁴ Certain other apparent exceptions occur in words which have lost
