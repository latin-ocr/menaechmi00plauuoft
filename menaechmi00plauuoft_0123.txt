Menaechmus (Μέναιχμος) and Sosicles (Σωσικλῆς) are rather
high-sounding names sor two inerehants. Menaechmus l and ll
correspond to Men. of Epidamnus and MemosSymcuse respectixely.

PROLOGVS. ln Roman Comedy, a Prologue, where there was
one, served one or both of two purposes : (1) like the παράβασις os
Old Greek Comedy it gave the poet an opportunity of answering his
critics and of asking the audience’s savoumble attention ε Terence's
prologues, which are all genuine, are wholly of this kind; (2) like
the opening speeches of Euripides’ plays and the prologues of Middle
and New Greek Comedy, it explains everything necessary sor the
understanding of the plot. T he prologues attached to Plautus’s
plays are mainly of this kind ; but it cannot with certainty be stated
that any of the twelve regular prologues extant are genuine except
those of the Aulularia, lx'udens, and T rimmmms. The Plautine
prologues merely serve the purpose of a programtne, and are spoken,
not by one of the characters os a play, but by an extraneous charac-
ter (e. g. the Lar Ezmiliaris in Aulul.) or by a member of the grex
specially dressed for the part (ornatu prologi) ; sor the latter device
cf. the Prologue in Shakespeare’s Henry V.

Among the indications of the spuriousness of the present
Prologue may be mentioned the large proportion of tnetrical
difficulties (13, 26, 39, 67, &c.); the frigid witticisms (3, 49); the
needless repetitions (43, 48); the contradiction between ll. band 15 ;
and the abruptness of l. 7. Possibly the Prologue is composed os
three different fragments (1—6, 7—16, 17-end) unskilfully patched
together.

follows turns on the literal sense of adporto.
