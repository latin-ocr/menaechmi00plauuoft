28 INTRODUCTION

ΙΙ. The principal metres employed by Plautus *are as
follow:
A. The Iambic Senarius (= Greek Iambic Trimeter

Acatalectic).

(a) This is a line of six feet, each of which is either an
iambus (υ —‘) or some foot reckoned as the metrical equivalent
of an iambus and permitted as a substitute therefor.

(b) In every foot but the last Plautus freely allows such
substitutes3 namely‚ the tribrach (υ ό υς the only exact
metrical equivalent) ; the spondee¹ (— έ); and the metrical
equivalents of the spondee, namely‚ the anapaest (υ υ —‘)‚ the
dactyl (— ό υ), and (rarely) the proceleusmatic (υ υ ό υ).

(c) A dactyl is seldom followed by an anapaest: in other
words, the concurrence of four short syllables is rare except in
an actual proceleusmatic foot (for explanation of an apparent
instance see 495 note).

(d) A dactyl is rare in the fifth soot 3 a proceleusmatic is
rarely used, and occurs chiefly in the first foot (e. g. v. 229 of
this play) ; an instance of a proceleusmatic in the second foot
occurs in v. 253 of this play.

(e) The last foot is normally an iambus, but may be a
pyrrhic (υ φ). In other words, literary convention permitted
a doubtful syllable (syllaba anceps) to stand at the end of a verse
of this kind, as of nearly every other kind.

(f) As the collocation of two iambic words would entail
a twofold conflict of accent with ictus,² the line may not end
with two iambic words except

(i) when change of speaker occurs between the fifth foot,

and the sixth 3
(ii) when there is elision immediately before tlrexfifth foot or
the sixth (e. g. 480);

¹ How the spondee could be regarded as the metrical equivalent of the
iambus hasbeen explained above, Ι. (c).
² See above, I. (a). ³ See 487 note.
