Such conventions helped the audience to follow the play,
and partly did away with the necessity sor a programme. Even
the matter-os-sact Roman had sufficient imagination to be able
to ‹lispense with detailed explanations and elaborately realistic
sccncry and cfsects, aids without which the faculties of amodern
audience would remain dormant and uncomprehending. The
student is advised to re-read those prologues-among the most
