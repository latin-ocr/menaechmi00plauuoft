MENAECHMI

Scan Ῑὲνξνέἓ ἕὲὄ, 1 Ere: hiatus at change of speakeris norma13
sor hiatus after &go cf. 7193 here it also precedes a vocative. See
further, Introd. 7. IV. D. a. iii. lt is possible also to scan ἔξω, Eril,
with hiatus following the vocative. Schwabe suggests (aude0>
audacissume, needlessly.

1004. The hiatus is legitimate, occurring as it does before
a vocative and· *at the diaeresis of an iambic octonarius ; see
Introd. 7. IV. D. a. iii; 6.11. C. c.

Epidamnii: sor the form cf. 2583 the form in -ensis is more
frequent in this play, occurring in 32, 57, 1000.

1004-5. erum . . . deripier: acc. and infin. in apposition to
fficium-3 or perhaps exclainatory, as in Amph. 882--3.

1005. pacato: i. e. a town with which his own town of Syracuse
was then on friendly terms )( hostili. Lambinus points out that
pacato, luci, in uia, liber form a sort of climax emphasizing the
indzgnilcts of the facinus.

luci, ‘in broad daylight ’ ; cf. Amph. 165 ;Cas. 786; sometimes
joined with a masc. or neut. adjective, as Aul. 748 luci claro ; cist.
525 cum primo luci. That luci in these phrases comes from an
I—stem with nomin. lucis (masc.) or luce (nent.) is evident from
Capt. 1008 lucis das tuendi copiam. Luci is not ⁴ temporal
locative '‚ but simply ablative of time ; cf. Cist. 525 (quoted above) ;
Alere. 2 55 mane cum luci semul ; Ter. Ad. 841 sum primo luci; so
the abl. of lux is used in classical Latin, e. g. Verg. Aen. iv. 186
luce sedet custos. Similar ablatives os time are uesperi, lteri,
temperi (cf. 1020, note).

1007. mittite, ‘let him go ⁹, addressed to the lorarii; cf. 1000,
1013, 1016.

The line is a trochaic octonarius.

1008. insignite: cf. Mil. 560 eam fieri. . . tam imag-nite iniu-
riam ; Cic. pro Quincl. 23. 73 z‘tzstgnz'te improbus.

1009. Scan dctbo ἔτ de?- ; but see App. Crit. Shortening legitimate ;
Introd. 7. 1. A. b, p. 42.

subuenibo: see note on 386 scib0; cf. 808, 1101.

1010. numquam: cf. 683 numquam fizclum reperies, and see
note on 533.

By this time Messenio has reached the struggling group; he now
tackles three of the four [orarii (cf. 1052), leaving the fourth to Men.

1011. istIe = isti-ce: dative (of disadvantage); cf. hisce 1012,
huic 1014. MSS. here read z'st1'; Onions, supposing haplography,

suggests isti, te ab umero. ‘N
ab umero: lit. ‘on the side of the shoulder'3 the prep. is
unnecessary.

1012. sementem . . . faciam: as we say, ‘plant blows’3 the
metaphor is continued in opseram. Sometimes the metaphor is, so
to speak, reversed ; the blows are a crop gathered from the sufferer’s
back, e. g. Aul. 45, where Staphyla is called stimulorum seges:
