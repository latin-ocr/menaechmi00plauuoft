MENAECHMI

mysterious; cf. Mem. 711 3 Asin. 864; Cas. 531 lzoc erat ecastor
quod me uir. . . arabat meus, ul properarem; Verg. Aen. ii. 664
,Ιιοι- crat, alma parens, quad me . . . eripis? Cf. also illuc (istuc)
esl quod(l=¹ud. 1258, διο). It is p0551ble in all these cases to take
the relative as adverbial (=pr0plcr quod; see note on 677 quid
cst quod) and the demonstrative as subject ; or, still taking
the relative-clause as subject, to regard the demonstrative as
adverbial.

Πῶς uocabat nomine: it is best to take this inv the sense
‘called you by his name ’, i.e. ‘called you Menaechmus ’, huius
referring to Men. Ι, to whom the name really belonged. Messenio
is addressing Meu. ΙΙ, who is properly Sosicles. lf the words are
taken as meaning ‘ invited you on his account ’, i. e. ‘ in mistake for
him ⁹, the sentence will be illogical, the explanation being mixed up
with the fact to be explained. Again, in 1136, where uocat does
mean ‘ invites '‚ its sense is defined by the words adprandium.

1136. hunc (i. e. Men. Ι) is complement, te subject, of esse.

quom uocat : historic pres. with quom was a colloquial usage ;
cf. 1115 quem . . . auelli! ; Amph. 668 quom abe03 Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 61
and 277.

1137. namque, ‘ (yeS‚) sor . . .'

hic: he points to Erotium's house: so lzuz'c 1139, lmc 1140.

f1138. clam as a preposition is followed by acc, in Plautus ς
c . 152.

1138-9. quoi pallam surrupui . . . eam dedi: loose asyndetal
arrangement of clauses ; or perhaps paratactic (eam sor quam). See
App. Crit. quoiam, suggested by Redslob, would necessitate
scanning ᾔχὸνεηι, and would here be relative, though quoius -a —um
is usually interrogative in Plautus3 cs. however Rud. 745. Ritschl
reads quoi quam pallam . . . eam dedi, which would be too stiff sor
conversation ; Brix puts a colon after domo 1138.

1139. hanc 3 he holds out the palla.

1142. Cf. 476, from which the missing word is supplied.

aurum hoc: he now displays the spinter.

1144—5. memet esse: supply te as subject. See App. Crit.;
Miiller proposes me esse, (credo), credidit. H avet’s suggestion
med adesse (corrupted into med esse) is perhaps the best ; Erotium
had been expecting Men. I back srorn a walk (cf. 213—15), and when
Men. II appeared, thought that Men. Ι had arrived.

1146. numquid me morare quin . . . siem? ‘I suppose you
put no obstacles in the way of my receiving nffleedomlst Cf.
Aul. 612 ne adfinem morer quin . . . meam . . . filiam ducat. Or
perhaps, if moror negatived ψ quin is here used as Livy (e. g. iii.
54. 4) uses moror negatived 4 quominus, ‘ I suppose you have no
objection to . . . ?’ me being anticipatory. In any case the words
are addressed to Men. ΙΙ ; cf. the next line.
