MENAECHMI

918. squamossas: Plautus did not write the word thus, as no
consonants were written double till Ennius's day; but the form
given here by the MSS. indicatesthat the adjective-suffix -o'sus
was originally -onsus (cf. formonsus), or rather ment-tos, where
-uent- = Gk. adjectival suffix-stem -οεντ- (nom. -όεις).

papae! an explosive interjection3 cf. atax, Gk. παπαῖ, βαβαί,
πόποι, Eng. ‘tut-tut ².

919-20. deliramenta loquitur: cs. Amph. 696; capt. 598.

921. percipit: sc. eum3 in its original sense, ‘ gets a thorough
grip on him ' ; cf. Amplz. 1118 horror membra . . . percipit. Contrast
916 occeptat . . . primulum. The use of indicative here after
priusquam, though the idea of purpose is present, may imply that
the Senex believes the fit is almost upon him ; cf. Verg. Aen. iv. 27
ante, Pudor, quam te uz'olo. For the lengthening of the final
syllable cf. 759 aduenit, 1 101 emeris ε Bothe proposes percipit
uesanz'a, but see note on 877.

922. occidis fabulans‚ ‘ you’re boring me ’ (or, ‘him') ‘to death
with your jabber'3 or, if occidis is used vividly for future, ‘you'll
be the death of me'⁷ ἃς. Perhaps it is best to supply me, not
eum, as the object; the Senex is weary of the quack's pseudo-
professional interrogatory‚ which he thinks quite unnecessary after
what he himself has seen (cf. 835 seq.): he wants the man to do
something; cf. 921, 946. In Β1 the words are assigned to Men.‚
perhaps rightly.

923. duri: probably of appearance, ‘staring’‚ ‘set in a fixed
stare ⁹, referring to the glare of a madman.

924. locustam, ‘lobster', which has staring prominent eyes3
cf. Pliny, H. N. xi. 37. 55 locustis . . . praeduri eminent (oculi).

925. enumquam . . . crepant: Warner tr. ‘ Doo not your guttes
gripe ye, and croake in your belly ? '

926. nulla crepitant: nullus in agreement with the subject is
used (as a rule colloquially) as a strong negative; cf. Rud. 143 z‘ll'
qui uocauit nullus ue7zz't; Trin. 606 at tu edepol nullus credua53
Cic. A tt. xi. 24. 4 Philotimus . . . nullus παίω Verg. Aen. iv. 272
si te nulla mouet tantarum gloria rerum.

927. pro insano, ‘like a madman ’ ; cf. 945, 298j27‘o sano ; Capi.
542 proque zgnolo me aspernari.

928. facilin . . . cubans? repeats the former question in a more
definite form3 ‘ do you sleep easily’ (i. e. without bad dreams such
as visit the insane) ‘when you are in bed?' Ritschl makes this
a distinct question by reading obdormis, with the sense< do you go
to sleep easily ' (i. e. readily) ‘ when you go to bed ? ’ ; but cubo does
not seem to bear this meaning elsewhere.

929-30. Cf. the opening scene of Aristoph. Nubes, where Strep-
siades cannot sleep for thinking of his debts.

931-3. qui = utinam; cs. 451 note.

There is no need to suppose a lacuna aster 9303 Men. suddenly
