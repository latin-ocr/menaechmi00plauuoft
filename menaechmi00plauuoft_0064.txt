The text and apparatus criticus of this edition are reprinted
from Professor Lindsay⁷s edition of Plautus in the Scriptorum
Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxom'ensis. In the app. crit. P denotes
a consensus of all minuscule MSS. (B, C, D) ; PCD a consensus
of C and D. The symbol codd. designates the highest possible
authority, a consensus of A and P 3 the symbol cod. denotes
either P (where A is lacking) or A (in the rare passages where
P is lacking). Thus, between ll. 595 and 1005, where A is
completely lacking, the symbol cod„ which appears frequently
in the app. crit„ means that MSS. of the P group are the sole

authority and are in agreement. Ὗ

¹ With regard to the relation between A and P, Leo holds that they are
both derived from a recension of the date of Hadrian ; Lindsay, that A is
derived from an original, P from an acting version.
