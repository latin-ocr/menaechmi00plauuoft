COMMENTARY: LINES 1041—54

medicus, 1042-5 being parenthetical, and illustrating the generaliza·
tion os 1041 by a particular case introduced by uel: cf. 873⁸.

1042. se petere argentum: sc. aiehat; ‘ said he was setching
going to get) ’.

1044. quo uolet: original mood retained.

1045. quando . . . factus sit: the force os the perfect is ⁴ when
he has been completely restored to sanity': or perhaps the tense
simply represents the fut. perf. indic„ which would here be normal.
The subjunctive is used here either to mark indefinite time (quando
= ὅταν), or to hint at the improbability of his recovery ; or may be
due to ‘meod-attraction‘‚ on which see Lindsay‚ ,S'yntax ‘ff Pl„
pp. 67-8. Scan sit, which retains its original quantity (=siel).
As Messenio has offered to bring him some money for no apparent
reason, Men. naturally concludes that he is mad, but proposes to
profit by that madness. Neither of the Menaechmi has a high
standard of honesty; cf. Men. 11‘s trickery, 524-49.

petat = repetat.

1047. nihilo esse . . . setius quam somnia ε 50. sunt; the adverb
in conjunction with esse as in the phrases benefici, &c.; cf. Truc.
172 longe aliter est amicus alque amntem Ter. l’lzorm. 529—30.

1049. si possum, ⁴ in the hope of’; for tense and mood see
note on 418. Men. thinks he had better at least pacisy his wife.

Men. 1 now disappears into the house of Erotium3 at the
same moment Men. 11 enters R. with Messenio. Men. II had
gone harbourwards with the intention of sailing away at once (878) 3
failing to find Messenio he had started back again, and had then
met Messenio, who was on the way to fetch the money for his
supposed master (1038), and whom he rates for giving him the slip.

1050. men . . . te : object and subject respectively of conuenisse.

1051. adnot-sum mi . . . uenires: cs. 437, note.

quin modo, ‘why, didn’t I just now . . .?' Used thus, quin
(= qui-ne, ‘how not ?’) is equivalent to nenne introducing 3 rhe-
torical question that makes or corroborates an assertion 3 cf. 10583
Capi. 1017 quin, inquam, intus hic est.

1052. homines qui = (ab) hominibus qui; so where antecedent
should be abl. alone, cf. 311 above; or dative, cf. Aul. 595 pueri
qui= pueris qui; Mil. 598. This attraction os the antecedent
to the relative is normal in Ο. Lat. when the antecedent stands in
the relative clause, as Mil. 155 ltic illest lepidus quem dixi senem.
It was in imitation of the less ordinary usage that Vergil wrote
urbem quam statuo uestra est, A en. i. 573.

sublimen: see note on 992.

1054. quom ego iczcurro: the indicative is quite normal after
quom, even in classical prose, when the quom-clause contains the
more important statement (so-called ¹ inverted‘ construction) ;
here the historic present is used for vividness (‘ when suddenly
I rusb up ⁸).
