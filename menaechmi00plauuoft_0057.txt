(b) words which are normally iambi, but which, when
ictus coincides with the natural accent on the first syllable,
may be scanned as pyrrhics : as 740 tfzax· 3 ῆαύνίζ In Vergil’s
τιᾶΙΙῖ, ηᾶίὲ, ξ ῗηᾳιιὶί accent alone has sufficed to shorten the final
syllable of a word of very common use occurring in hiatus and
lacking ictus.

C. Hiatus is of frequent occurrence at a metrical pause,
especially in a long line such as the trochaic septenarius, where
it was natural for an actor to take breath at the end of the
first hemistich 3 in the shorter iambic senarius such pause was
less needed, and when hiatus occurs at the caesura it may
usually be referred to another cause.¹ Instances of either
kind are:

(a.) Hiatus at the diaeresis of a trochaic septenarius; very

1013, 1091, 1112, δῖε. ; especially frequent when diaeresis
coincides with a pause in sense or delivery: e. g. with change
of speaker, as in 156, 379, 384, 422, 650, 651, 821, 868, 937,
1075, 1077, 1094 3 with a strong pause or contrast in sense, as
in 219, 431, 808, 8473 with a pause before or after an inter-
iection or parenthetic word, as in 673, 696, 851 ,- with anaphora,
as in 939—403 with a pause in a line delivered with cornic
solemnity, as in 859.

¹ It is obvious that when hiatus occurs ata metrical pause the unelided
syllable can never bear ictus. With regard to its quantity, it is sasest to
take it as doubtful, unless the metrical pause coincides with a pause in
sense or delivery, in which case the unelided syllable retains its sull value.
