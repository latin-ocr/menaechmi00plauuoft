MENAECHMI

or less than the truth inserted in the terms of the sponsio. On the
other hand Teuffel's first rendering lacks point, though it does not
conflict with his interpretation of praedem dedit (see below, iii).

A few other suggestions may be noted. Ritschl, followed by
Brixb ² reads plus minus (= circiter) ; but in the passage given as
a parallel, Capt. 995, the phrase used is plus minusque, which
there means ‘ both more and less '. Sicker‚ followed by Niemeyer,
reads dixeram in controuersiam (haplography). Onions shows that
comparatively few and trifling changes are needed to rearrange
ll. 592 to 597 (meis) as a continuous passage of trochaic septenarii.

593-4. quid i11¹ qui praedem dedit? nec magis, &c. There
can be no objection to taking nec here in its ordinary adversative
meaning of and yet . . . not, the general sense of the passage being:
‘ I took the utmost pains to get the case settled by a sponsio—and
what d’ye think of my cliens, who was fool enough to insist
on a regular hearing? And yet (in that case he was bound to
be defeated, for) never have I seen a man who was more obviously
in the wrong: there were three strong witnesses against him (whose
evidence might, however, have been evaded by means of a tricky
sponsio).’ Teuffel raises the curious objection that, if praedem dedit
is taken here in its usual sense of‘gave security for the mesne
profits ’‚ i. e. ‘let the case proceed to a regular hearing in iudicio ’
(see Notes, 590), nec will be meaningless. Apparently he imagines
that nec must mean nor indeed (i. e. must be corroborative‚ and
cannot be adversative). He takes praedem dedit in the sense
of ‘ gave security for the penalty ' (i. e. as though already convicted),
and interprets the passage as follows: ‘What of my cliens, who
caved in ?—-and indeed I never saw a man more obviously in the
wrong: (more rascal he for wasting my time).’

This interpretation is open to grave objections, namely ε

(i) Men.’s general complaint about having his time wasted is
contained in ll. 585—9: in 11. 590—5 he gives vent to the particular
complaint that in this case he wasted not only his time but his
labour and ingenuity‚ He would in any case (even if his cliens had
won) have wasted his time ; his labour would not have been wasted
if his cliens had acted sensibly.

(ii) According to this interpretation Men.5 with absurd inconsis-
tency, first complains that his cliens caved in, and then immediately
uses words which imply that he was right in doing so.

(iii) 1f the cliens gave surety for a penalty (i. e. a fine), the point
at issue must have been some offence committed by ' ; therefore

this interpretation conflicts with Teuffel’s second interpretation of
haut plus haut minus as given above.

(iv) A surety for a penalty was vas not praes.
Teuffel’s alternative proposal, to take praedem dedit in the sense

here preferred, and to shift 11. 594—5 so as to follow l. 589, is quite
unnecessary if nec is taken in its adversative sense.
