COMMENTARY: rmus 6⁶4-87

680. bis tanta pluris, ‘ worth twice as much ' ; one would
expect lanso, but one MS. (13¹) here, and all MSS. in 800 (mulla
tanta . . . amplius) read lanta ; cf. lcml. 521 multo lanta miserior;
Stich. 339 mullo tanta plum Cic. Vcrr. 11. iii. 97 quinquies tanta
amplius. Probably the word thus used is a technical expression
employed in arithmetic or commerce. Havet suggests that there is
an ellipse of pecunia ; i. e. here bis tanlci pluris = bis tanta pecunia
pluris, lit. ‘ at a larger price by twice as much money '‚ i. e. ‘ twice
as expensive ’. This explanation fits the expressions used here
and in the passage of Cicero quoted above; the phrase multo tanta
with a comparative, which occurs in the other passages quoted, and
which is found in late authors (e.g. Appuleius, Met. vii. 15 ; x. 21),
seems to be a popular extension of the usage by false analogy.

quam uoles: either with bis tanta plurim or take quam as
indes. relative (not only is it to be more costly‚ but she can have
the feminine pleasure of choosing it herself). Brix ⁸ reads quom.

681. fit ferres: contrastst'rres in next line. For change os accent
due to difference of grouping cf. 281—2‚ and see note on 321—2.

682. fieret nouom = reconcinnaretur; cf. 527.

683. mihi tu ut dederis pallam . . . ’ἒ ‘What? you gave me the
mantle ? ’ ut with the subjunctive is thus used in indignant questions
rejecting a thought or statement as absurd or untrue ; sometimes it
is joined to an interrogative particle, as Cure. 616 mean ancilla
libera ut sit, quam ego numquam emisi manu? The usage is found
in classical Latin, e. g. Cic. Cat. i. 9. 22 le ut ulla res frangat? tu
ut umquam te corrigas ,ἲ Cic. T usc. ii. 1 8. 42 egone ut le interpellem ,θ
The construction is sometimes explained as due to an ellipse of
fierine potest3 and here it would be possible, though less idiomatic‚
to mke ut dederis as dependent on factum (esse). See also 299
note, and Lindsay‚ syntax os Pl„ p. 66.

numquam . . . reperies: see 533 note, and cf. Poen. 762.

684. postquam, ‘since '. Replace the colon at end os line by
a comma.

685. nunc: sc. primum.

postillac ( = postilla3 sor form cf. posthac) repeats colloquially
the post osposlquam. (Not in Lewis and Short.)
quam rem agis, ‘what you are driving at ', ‘what your game is’.

686. quia commisi, ἃς. : either (1) take ut me defrudes as
depending on commisi: ‘because I have given you an opportunity
os cheating me’; or (2) take quia commisi absolutely, ‘because
1 was trusting’, and make ut me defrudes explanatory of ad eam
rem. Th'e latter interpretation gives more point to the next line,
and has a parallel in Aul. 574-5 scio quam rem agat,· ut sne
deponat uino, eam adfectat uiam. Bothe suggests quae commu-1 ;
i. e. ut me desrudes (eis) quae (tibi) commisi.

687. Men. imagines that she means he is now trying to get the
things from her.
