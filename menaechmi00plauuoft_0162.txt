MENAECHMI

544. cedo: cf. 197, 546. Hiatus is justified by the strong pause
(occurring at caesura); cs. 546, 737, 898.
545. da: sc. aurum.
sodes = si audes: see on sultis, 350.
aps te = de tua pecunia.
poste: archaic form of post3 cf. 838. Spengel proposes ego
post, whereby 546 is a comic echo of 545 ; but contrast requires ego
m the next line ; here it is unnecessary.

551. Cf. Epid. 192.
554. fer pedem, ‘ step along ’.
confer: Brix reads profer on the ground that confirm gradum
means ‘ join or rneet some one' ; cf. Pseud. 707 : but con· may also
be an intensive prefix, as in concito, comminuo, ἃς.
555. ad laeuam: the spectators’ right, the way to the forum3

cf. 565-7. He himself goes R. towards the harbour to find Messenio, ,

who is waiting at a waterside hostelry, 436.

for mixture of numbers cf. 522-3 uti quemque conspicor . . . ludi-

ficant. If quis is omitted, the subject is indefinite ‘they ⁹. Brix’s

original reading was manum ut Η Si qui l sequantlur.

sequantur : so-called ‘ subj. by attraction ’ ; cf. Rud. 1128 ac si
istorum nil sil, ut mihi reddas. Nonius quotes the line as ut si
sequentur. On this question of ‘mood-attraction’ see Lindsay,
Syntax of Plautus, V. 29.

There is an echo of this speech in Shakespeare's Comea'y qf
Errors, 111. ii. adfin.

I see a man here needs not live by shists,
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
I’ll to the mart, and there sor Dromio stay ε

1f any ship put out, then straight away.

When Menaechmus 11 departs harbourwards the stage is
empty, and the third pause in the play occurs-NSpon Matrona
(i. e. Menaechmus I’s wife) and Peniculus, who has fulfilled his
threat of 518-19‚ come out of Menaechmus l’s house.

559. frustra: sc. esse: ‘to be hoodwinked'3 cf. Amph. 974 et
εῗνιόιω et era fivtslrcz sunt duo: more usually ‘to be mistaken’;
