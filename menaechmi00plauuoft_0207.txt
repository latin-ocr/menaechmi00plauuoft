COMMENTARY: LINES 1054—76

1064. noscito, ‘take stock of'. Cf..1mpl1.441 quom illum
tonte ·‹.mpl‹› ·ts‹›rm‹ tm cog 'mltos ι) me am.

1065. Men. 1 now catches sight of Messenio, and hastens to
address him, having designs on the mc zrsuppim

1068. Menaechmo: cf. 43. The use of the appositional dative
in this and similar phrases is common in O. Lat.

1069. domus et patria: Biicheler's correction ιἰ ιιιίι m urbs is
unnecessary‚ as damus and palma refer to Syracusae and Siciluz
respectively. Havet sugges ts domus ιί pz'cclrz< ι e> ι esl mi'2ltz he
thinks that the bracketed letters have been omitted by haplography,
and ea restored in the wrong place. This certainly lmproves the
rh thm.

11070. 11οο . . . est: Men. 11, thinking the other a trickster (cf.
1077—8)‚ answers churlishly.

res, ‘thetruth '.

noui equidem hunc, ‘ well, at any rate Ι know this one';
11010 Μο55., who has himself got confused between them, points
to Men. 1. His error continues throughout his speech; he
sets himself right in 1076; cf. 1084—5. Similarly in the Com. of
Err. the Duke addresses the wrong Andpholus, ν. 1. 362: DuAe.
Antipholus‚ thou cam 'st from Corinth first? Aul. „25 No, sir,
not1; Icame from Syracuse. l)uA.e Stay, stand apart31 know
not which 15 which.

1071. egoquidem evidently emphasizes the first person more
than equidem 1070.

huiius . . .huiius: pointing to Men. 1 and Men. 11 re-

hune. .huic: referring to Men. 11.

exhibui negotium: i.e. by asking him for 1115 freedom3 Gk.
πράγματα παρεῖχον.
1073. This apology is addressed to Men. II.
stulte . . . atque inprudens: for union of adv. and adj. used
adverbially cf. Capt. 960. We should say, ‘if I said anything foolish
unawares’
1074-5. Μ.011 ΙΙ clears up the confusion by a pertinent question.
1076. Τ110 sentences in this line are addressed alternately to
Men. 11 and Men. 1. Mess. now distinguishes them correctly.
A speaker similarly addresses two interlocutors alternately in
Rud.1089.
tu seruom quaere: to Men. Ι, ‘you must look for (another)
slave’. For this use of quaerere cf. Livy iii. 45. 11 sleat . con·
di‘czonem (‘ a new match’ ) filzae quaerendam esse.
tu salueto. tu nale, ‘greeting to thee' (to Men. II); ‘-fare
well to thee' (to Men. 1). This seems better than to take both
these sentences as addressed to Men. 1 in the sense ‘farewell and
prosper ’,01 ‘farewell sor ever ²(the formula uttered over the dead).
