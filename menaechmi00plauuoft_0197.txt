‚¹ COMMENTARY: Lmsss 966-83b

parative cs. 55: Aul. 42²· Scan quam malam& mim. 'she tisth
foot is a proceleusmatic.

uerba : uerbera: cf. Ter. Heaut. 356 liblerunt parata uerba,
huic homini verberas Ovid, ller. x. 38 uer-hera cum uerbis mixta
suere meis. Messenio can put up with a scolding.

79. nimio = multa, but has stronger force. Scan labefntms ἱ
m Ιίίιῐνῃ Ι ᾳιιιΐιη nm Ιῗίιῐηι. ,

molitum: sc. sa1r3 mollitum, ⁴ strenuous efforU, verbal noun
from molior, with punning reference to mfflz‘tum: ‘ 1 much prefer
eating what others grind to the dreadsul grind—of grinding’: the
word-play balances that in 978. illast-sus is not found elsewhere,
but there are several other verbals in -lus (e. g. frustratus, pet-dilus)
that Plautus alone uses, and he only once. To take the line other-
wise involves the scansion ΙήΙτ annas „mmmm quam Ι νηὸίίίῂηι,
but such variation os stress (molimine, ma'litum) cannot here be
justified (see 321-2 note) ; moreover the repetition of mu'lltum would
be both utterly pointless‚ and bad Latin. On praclu'hco see 802 note.

980. seruo id: cf. Pseud. 698 seruas imperium probe.

98'2. alii sei . . . sint, ego . . . ero: the indicative of the
apodosis expresses certainty, the subjunctive of the protasis leaves
the question open. The MSS. read aliis ἔὲ (= esse), from which
Lindsay gets aliisei by change of one letter and redit-ision (see also
App. Crit.). The second hand ofss gives alii csse, which Niem.-I3rix
adopts, taking the first esse as subject to in rem esse. A literal
translation os this reading would run : ‘Let others be as they think
it to be to their interest to be ’. A ⁴ monstrases 1 V ortspiel ' on esse
(edere) such as Brix⁶ suspects would here be feeble and un-Plautine.
Scan &ro iit 7ηέ Ι k‘sse ε the line is trochaic.

983. metum id . . . adhibeam . . . apstineam: cf. 2493 a con-
ditional sentence without si expoessed, apstineam being apodosis:
¹ 1f only 1 keep this before me as a matter sor anxiety,’ ἃς. : id is
explained by ero ut . . . sim praes-tm for careless order cf. 966-9,
972—3. See also note on 984. Scan melum Id mt‘lzidd- (proceleus-
matic), and Ιόιῖς sim : the line is anapaestic.

culpam apstineam: sor this acc, cf. Mil. ¹309 si apstinuzksem
amorem ; contrast 768 above, apstinent saepe culpa.

983⁸. metuont: i. e. behave cautiously. show a wholesome awe.
This line and the next closely resemble ΛΙω-ί. 8 58-61 both in senti-
ment and language. Scan ειῖνὲηί ηιὲιιὶζῡηί ΐ Ι sdlae‘n! e'v‘sffse ssrz's
zitlibiles (anapaestic). For shortenings see Introd. 7. l. Β. b, p. 43.

9835. nil metuont : metuont as in last line.

postquam . . . metuont : here metuant has a stronger mean—
ing, ‘ are {rightened '. Various emendations os this line have been
suggested ς the general sense is obviously that reckless slaves,
aster they have done something to deserve a beating, then (when
it is too late) do become afraid. Vahlen, incorporating a conjec—
ture os Pylades, reads promeriti, tunc ι’ metuont (see App. C rit.) ; sor
