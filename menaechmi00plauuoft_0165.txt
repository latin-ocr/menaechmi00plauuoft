587. aut ad populum . . . rest : the three principa! types of legal
cases at Rome: ad populum refers to criminal cases (causae
publicae) tried before the comitia centuriata ; 1'n iure (⁶ in the
magistrate's court '> refers (1) to civil cases (causae primane)
settled summarily by a magistrate giving judgment on points of law
when the facts were not disputed, (2) to a preliminary judgment by
a magistrate on points of law in a civil case where the facts were
disputed (the question of fact being tried in indit-ion ad iudicem
(= in iudicio, ‘before an arbitrator ') refers to civil cases of the
last-mentioned type, which were referred by the magistrate (after
proceedings in iure) to an unofficial arbitrator who gave judgment
on questions of fact. In a sponsio (see 590 note), as being concerned
with qt61estions of fact, the award was made by a iudex. Cf. willonis,

589. attinit . . . detinit: the simple verb teneo had an archaic
reduplicated perfect felini, quoted by Nonius, 178, from Pacuvius
and Accius; in compounds the first syllable would tend to dis—
appear, owing to the throwing back of the accent (cf. rettuls=
re'teluli). With this reading the line is trochaic (scan ‹ittfnlfft ῐίιῖ) :
if the reading of P is retained, me ιίίΙίῖηῆΐίΙ, {td ιίέξίίητιίί, the line is
anapaestic.

590. apud aedilis, &c.: the aediles had jurisdiction in iure in
cases connected with trade, commerce, and money-lending; cf.
WiHems, p. 271. Under ordinary circumstances the aedile made a
pronouncement on the legal aspects of the case, and appointed
a iudex to decide on the question of fact ; pending proceedings in
iudicio the party in possession of the disputed property or money
had to find sureties for the thing or sum disputed and for the mesne
profits ( praedes litis el uz'ndz'ciarum ; cf. 593). Actual proceedings,
however, might be avoided by a sponsio, which was a sort of legal
wager to decide the question of fact: each of the opposed parties
bound himselfto pay an'agreed sum if his statement were adjudged
false by a iudex. The party who desired a sponsio challenged the
other in a set form of words; e. g. si res de qua agitur mea est,
sestertios xxv nummos dare spondes ,9 In this formula the si-
clause (condicio) was of course variable, and might in some cases be
so ingeniously worded (cf. 591) as to put the challenged party in the
wrong; while the refusal of the latter to accept the challenge‚ no
less than failure to win the sponsio, was tantamount to a praeiudi-
cium (preliminary verdict). In this case Menaechmus, knowing
that if the case proceeded in the ordinary way his client would not
have a leg to stand upon (594—5)‚ made desperate efforts to substitute
