as objects; cf. Cic. adAtt. v. 1. 3 antecesserat Slah'us ul prandium
nobis uideret.

221. neque . . . supersit: with the punctuation in the text ‹lfss'as
and supersit are impersonal‚ and neque. . . neque stand for tecm· . . ,
neue. By removal of the stop at satis, 220, the words may be taken
as a continuation of the relative clause. Scan qwffismads by
synizesis; cf. 577.

222. Scan {gro et Asenssaccltmum see Introd. 7. l. A. b, and cf.
320 ἄη ὄρἷοηο, 468, 1009.

223. On the hiatus sce Introd. 7. IV. 1³. To avoid it here
Palmer reads hominum unus munus, and Muretus munus lwmz'-
num. There is a similar joke in a fragment of Eubulus quoted by
Athenaeus, i. 14.

munus . . . fungitur: the acc. with fungar and similar verbs
is the older usage, and appears normally in Plautus with fungor
(cf. T rin. 1), potior (dep.)‚ and abactor: with fruor and utar he
generally uses abl.

225. cocta sunt: sc. opsonia, or perhaps indeterminate ; ⁶ every-
thing is as good as cooked ’.

226. Menaechmus II (of Syracuse) and Messenio, as coming
from the harbour, enter the stage R. (from the spectators' left),
accompanied by sailors with baggage; cf. 350, 436. Men. 11 has
left his conventional traveller's garb of chlamys and petasus at the
ship, and appears like Men. 1 in pallium; hence confusion is easy.
On these points cf. Introd. 4.

227. Scan qucz'm Ι Ψιόυι dr: this is permissible (cf. Introd. 7. IV.
A. b. ii), though quam quando (Lactantius) and quam si quam
(Brix) have been suggested.

228. terram conspiciunt: cf. the proverbial terram uidere
expressive of relief after anxiety, as in Cic. de Sem. 19. 71 ut .. .
quasi terram uidere uideam so pro Mur. 2. 4.

non dicam dolo, ‘ I’ll speak plainly ', lit. ‘without subterfuge ¹ ;
cf. Τ rin. 90, 480.

229. quasi . . . uideas: quasi here = quam si, as elsewhere in
Plautus; cf. T rin. 266 peius perit quasi saxo saliat ; A ul . 231 3 so
1101 below tam quasi = tamquam si. The sense is ⁴ It's a greater
pleasure (to see land at all) than if you were to set eyes on the
country that was (once) your own’: a humorous exaggeration.
P has quam si, which must be altered metri gralia3 the first soot
is a proceleusmatic. Most edd. read si, with the sense ‘ It would be
a still greater pleasure‚ if you were to see your own country’; but
in A the line begins with q . . . Perhaps quom (= ὅταν) is to be read.

fuerit: the tense implies that Men. has been so long' a
wanderer that he can hardly be said to have a patria. Cf. Vergil's
fuimus Troes. Subjunctive possibly due to ‘ mood-attraction '.

230. Scan qudmdblrem. · ἢ ⁸

231. quasi mare: sc. cirrumz't. W‘hen circumire is written ..s
