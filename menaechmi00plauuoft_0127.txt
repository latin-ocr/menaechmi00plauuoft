COMMENTARY: LmEs 38-74

51. Epidamnum: the accusative is natural, as he must go
to Epidamnus before he can transact anyone's business there. lt is
an accusative of motion used pregnantly with a verb of rest.

523Scan· ηεῐῖζς Plautus often retains the original long quantity of
verb-inflexions m -s, -e, and -or, when the syllable bears ictus. See
Introd. 7. 111. a, and cf. 759 aduenit, 921, 956.

h53. ἰὶξὴιῖίξ det: limitative, ‘but not forgetting to give me thc
w erewr a .

54. egerit: the force of the tense here and in 55 is ‘ he will find
he has been acting foolishly ’; cf. 661.

55. magi’ maiores: for the double comparative cf. 978 mage*
multo patior saciliu' uerba. For the whole of this passage cf. poi-n.
prol. 79-82. Teuffel regards 51-6 as an alternative passage to 49-
50. Perhaps there is here a punning reference to the sound of the
name Epidamnum (ἐπὶ damnum) ; ct. note on 263.

56. illue . . . unde abii : a repetition (or alternative) of 49: the
Prologue returns in imagination to Epidamnus, where he remains
till the end (uno asto in loc0; cf. 72—6). The words are also
figurative ; cf. Hor. Sat. i. 1. 108.

59. ei: a monosyllable3 cf. 61 e‘z‘que, 874 ἒῐ.

ei . . . nihil erat by anacoluthon after Epidanmsensis ill· 57.
The carelessness of colloquial speech is imitated, cf. 64-5; l'ocn.
659 tu, sei te di amant, agere luam rem occasiost3 Shakespearc,
Henry V, iv. 3. 35 : ‘ he which hath no stomach to this fight,
Let him depart '.

nisi diuitiae : which he loved with a father's love.

60. surrupticium: see on Arg. 2.

62. heredem fecit: i. e. gave him his inheritance by dying (not
‘made him his heir', that being implied in adaptat .. . sibifilium
60—1). Cf. Poen. 77, and see 477 note.

63. ut ibat, ‘ as he was going '. ut .. . pluerat,‘ when (after) it
had been raining ’. The quantity plricmt is justified by a passage in
Varro (L. L. ix. 104), where he states that in his day correct pronun-
ciation distinguished the perfect of words like pluo, luo, from the
present by a lengthening of the u. The original form of the word
was plouo (cf. Gk. πλέῇω); Priscian quotes perf. plauit from Livy.

64, 65. ingressus . . . raptori ε for the anacoluthon cf. 57-9.

raptori pueri = ei qui puerum rapuerat ; see note on 274.

66. malam crucem : this phrase, like mala res, is regarded
as a single word, and so can be qualified by an adjective. See also
328 note.

67. See App. Crit. and Introd. 7. IV. C. b, p. 53.

68. illic: at Epidamnus.

69. habet: simple verb for frequentative habitam cf. Aul. 5
qui nunc hic habet, Trin. 193, 390, and our old-fashioned ‘ keeps ’.

72. haec : pointing to the houses represented on the stage.

74. familiae: the households of the stage houses; explained by
