two per cent. of the real value os the goods. Havet accepts this
conjecture, ancl, on the ground that Messenio had not met the
Matrona, while Men. 11 had experienced her tongue and temper,
alters and redistributes ll. ubo-1 thus :

ΜΕΝ. 11. VcnibiKne) uxor quoquc ,9 ΜΕΝ. 1. liliam si quis

emptor ueneris,
uix, credo, tola auctione capiet quinquagesinum .·

the last speech meaning, ‘ (Yes, but) even ifany purchaser turns up,
1 hardly think that she will fetch two per cent. of the proceeds
as she stands (tom) ’. Havet does not, however, adequately
prove that auctione = auctionis by his reference to capt. 569 ; and
both his suggestion and Leo's weaken the comica uis of the
passage. The text used by Warner seems to have assigned etiam
. . . uenerit to Men. 1, as he translates 1160 thus : Mess. . . . ‘Will
ye sell your wife too Sir ? ‘ Alen. Cz't. ‘ Yes, but 1 think no bodie will
bid money for her.’

1162. plaudite: cf. Hor. AJ’. 15 5 donec cantor ‘ uos plaudite’
dicat. The plays of Plautus and Terence regularly end with a
request sor applause, made either by the last speaker in the play,
as for instance here and in Amph„ Mil„ Most„ Rud.; or by the
grex or caterua (the whole troupe of amors), as in Caph, Trin„ &c. ς
or by the cantor (actor employed to sing the cantica), as in Τ erence’s
plays. Shakespeare imitates this usage, e.g. in the Epilogue to
All's Well, ‘ Your gentle hands lend us ’, and in the closing words
of M. -N. D„ ‘Give me your hands, if we be friends ‘.

APPENDD( oN u.. 590-5

592-3. Of the many suggested emendations of this verse perhaps
the best is Ritschl’s dixi, eam (better, dia-ei, eam) controuersiam
ut Η sponsio finiret (Vahlen dzffi’rret: i. e. put off the final decision).
This gives the same sense as the present text. Brix³ adopts these
changes, and further alters aut plus aut minus to baud. . . haud m. (or
haut . . . haut m.). Teuffel supports the latter change, and interprets
the passage as meaning, either : Men. being in a hurry said no more
than was necessary, but at the same time no less; or, preferably: Men.
did not sall into the error of saying (claiming) too much or too
little. To illustrate the latter rendering he refers to Cic. de Orat. i.
36. 166-8, where a story is told οἱ an advocate’s endangering
his case by claiming too much through ignorance of the law ;
cf. Most. 631—2 DA. nihilo plus peto. TR. uelim quidem hercle ut
uno nummo plus petas (Le. for then you would lose your case).
These parallels are hardly appropriate3 sor (i) if the cliens was
making a claim at all, his clairn was evidently a fraudulent one:
Cicero’s point was that the advocate had a just claim, but claimed
slightly more than was due3 and (ii) since Men. knew his cliens to
be in the wrong (594), it must surely have been his aim to get more
