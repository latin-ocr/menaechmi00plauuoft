COMMENTARY: LINES 1076-1101

hiatus, not aster hominem (see App. Crit.), but after 111'1l1'; the last
thrtle worgs are spoken slowly and impressively ; see Introd. 7. lv.
D. ‚ . .
hgmsinis: sc. alterius. lt is probable that similis was
invariably followed by a genitive in Plautus: in the few places
where MSS. give dative, they should be altered (as here, where the
source of error is obvious). See Lindsay's Caph'm', note on 582.
similiorem numquam uidi : sc. quam hic tui cst similis; or,
better, read comma at end of line.
d· 1089. aqua aquae: cf. Mil. 551—2‚ and Fr. comme deux gomses
cau.
nec lacte est lactis‚'&c.: the same expression Amph. 601;
Mil. 240; the English equivalent is ‘as like as two peas'. For
the archaic nom. lacte cf. passages just cited, and Bacch. 1134.
1090. autem, ‘ moreover ’.
poste: introducing another argument; Gk. ἔπειτα. On the
form cf. 838, note.

1091. meliust: classical prose mellus erit with perf. infin.
Cf. 329.

hunc (= Men. 1,) is the object of both infinitives. Hiatus at
the diaeresis. Havet suggests llum· (me) percontarier3 this would
improve the rhythm, and give point to penge . . . esse, 1093-43 and
it is Messenio alone that conducts the investigation.

1092. hercle qui : cf. note on 428.

1093. si iuuenis: for colloquial substitution of pres. sor fut. in
the protasis of a conditional sentence referring to the future cf.
Mil. 1213 diuitias dabo, si z‘mpetras3 Capt. 331, and the phrase
si sapis. See also 847, note.

1094. spero ε sc. me inuenturum (as then he would get his
freedom).

1095. quid ais tu '3 addressed to Men. Ι.

1096-8. Messenio addresses Men. 1: huic . . . ln'c . . . lzuic
refer to Men. 11.

1098. dixti ι huic : hiatus at a pause between antithetical clauses,
or scan dixti: Ιιιῖἱῗε. Possibly dixisti should be read3 but sor
dixti closely following dixisti cf. [llere. 658.

1099. operam . . . mihi dare ε in a double sense, ‘ give me your
attention ⁹, and ⁴ do me a service ' (i.e. by procuring me my freedom).
With uobis, operam dare has latter sense only.

1100. quod uelis: object of impetres; cf. Mil. 1200 quod uolui
. . . impetraui; capt. 232-3.

1101. tam quasi = tamquam si, quasi being a shortened form
of quam si. Cf. Curc. 51 tam . . . quasi soror mea sit with Asin.
427 tamquam si claudu' sim.

emeris: cf. 921 perczpt‘t.
seruibo: sor this form cf. Aserc. 546, and see note on scibo,
386 above.
