MENAECHMI

this arrangement gives better force than to regard the line as
independent ofpmge, 150, and to read with Onions habemus, hunc,
or with Vahlen clam uxorem esl uln- sepulcrum habeam aitque hunc
comburam diem (which throws a faulty emphasis on atque). See
App. Crit. The metaphor is from a corpse about to be laid on the
pyre and interred (the cena being taken in the evening, when the
day was dead); it is continued in 153 incendo rogum and 154 ad
mnbilicum . . . mm‘tu05; perhaps there is a reference to the nouen-
dlalz's cena, or ‘funeral baked meats ’. Cf. too the opening of Gray's
Elegy. Havet‚ who agrees with Ussing in regarding sepulchrum as
a corruption due to the words following, proposes to read clam
uxorem ubi sit pulchre habemus qu? hunc c. d. ; ‘ we have the means
of celebrating the day's wake where we can enjoy ourselves‚' ἃς.
An objection to this is that the order is confused.

153. aequom oras: possibly ‘that¹s a reasonable request’, in
reference to perge, 15o; more probably the meaning is, as usually in
Plautus, ‘ what you say is reasonable '; cf. illast. 682 3 Pers. 587.

incendo: the pres. indic. ‘deliberative’ is usual after quam
mox in colloquial Latin ; cf. Bacch. 775, Mil. 1406 quam mox seco ,9
and, in English, phrases‘ like ⁶ How soon do we start?'

154-5. ad umbilicum . . . mortuos: i. e. it is already asternoon.
The use of mabillam (as of ὀμφαλός in Gk.) is common in the sense
of ‘middle’; it is imitated by Milton, Comus 520: ‘Within the
navel of this hideous wood.’ Havet, regarding the transference of
this meaning of umbilicus from the sphere of space to that of time
as impossible (though a similar confusion occurs below, 177, by way
of a joke), suggests that here, as in Pliny, N. H. vi, ξ 212, the word
refers to the gnomon of a sundial. He shows that the first correctly
orientated sundial easily accessible to the public of Rome was one
which was set up by Q. Marcius Philippus in 164 B.C., twenty years
after Plautus⁷s death, and which aroused great popular interest (cf.
Pliny, N. H. vii, ἓξ 21344). He conjectures that this line is a
topical ⁴ gag' introduced by some actor or magister gregis during
a performance of the play at this date, and that the meaning is
‘The day’s half-gone already by the (new) sundial’. This is
ingenious, but far—fetched; nor does it account for the combination
ad umbilicum. ,mortuos A more probable explanation is that
the expression is a metaphor from that kind of death in which
cessation of vitality proceeds from the feet upwards; cf. Plato,
Phaedo 117 E- 118 A, esp. και αὐτὸς ἥπτετο και ειπεν ὅτι, ἐπειδὰν πρὸς τῇ
καρδίᾳ ’γενηται (SC. το ψῦχος) αυτῷ, τότε otxv'joerENnd MistreSS
Quickly’s description of Falstaff’s death (Hemy V, 11. iii. 26):
‘ Then Ι felt to his knees, and so upward and upxyvard, and all was
as cold as any stone?

156. Note the hiatus at change of speakers, here coinciding with
the diaeresis, as frequently, e. g. 379, 384, 650, 868, 937, 1075, 1077,

1094.
