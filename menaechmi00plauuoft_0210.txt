1105. possum : spoken with a lordly air.
agite uterque . . . dicite: cf. notes on 674, 779, 1119.

1106. quod sciam: not here limitative, but relative with sub-
junctive of generalitation.

1107-22. This long-drawn interrogatory is tedious to read, but
would.be made amusing on the stage by the airs assumed by
Messenio in his role of detective, and by the evident enjoyment
with which he conducts the cross-examination; cf. 1114, 1121.

1110. conueniunt, ‘tally'; cf. 11313 Ter. l’lcor. 53 conueniet
numerus quantum debui.

1111. longissume, ‘surthest back'3 i.e. ‘what is your earliest
recollection ἒ ’

1112. ut abii, ‘when 1 went away’; this temporal clause is
resumed by a redundant postea. lt is better to take it thus than
to suppose a double construction after the unexpressed memini,
namely ut abii . . . me deerrare, ‘how I went . . . (and) that I
strayed '. For the facts cf. 24—33.

abii Tarentum: the best MS. available (B) here reads
habitarem tum: other MSS. aluiz· tarentum variously divided;
while for auehi in 1 113 Β1 and 13² read abiit and abii respectively.
Havet‚ ingeniously arguing srom the order in which the circum-
stances would have impressed themselves on a child's memory‚

proposes cum patre ut naui Tarentum, supposing that naui was '

corrupted successively into nabi, habi (B), and abii (PCD). He
further suggests that the ΛΜΨ) of B at the end of 1113 represents
an abii displaced from 1112, which he replaces thus: crim patre ut
nauz' Tarentum a(biz· ά>ιί mercatum, po'stca. (Cf. 26-7, clearly
derived from this line.)

1113. Scan m? deerrare, or m? [ἱῖεννιῖνέ with hiatus at diaeresis.

1114. serua me! ‘protect rne', i. e. grant that 1 be not dis-
appointed. A phrase used when an unhoped-for joy seems to be
on the verge of fulfilment; cf. Capt. 976; Cure. 640. Cf. the
complementary phrase used when there is no longer any doubt,

112Otluid . . . taces? to Men. 11. Messenio will have no inter-

ruption3 he wishes to complete his detective triumph3 cf. 1121.
1115. Messenio further questions Men. I.
patria has first syllable short in Plautus, and is therefore
followed by hiatus here, perhaps owing to the influence of the lost
ablative-ending -d3 but see App. Crit. Cf. 1151.

1116. septuennis: cf. 24. β
cadebant primulum, ‘were just beginninffto be shed'.

Domestic detail of this sort is often introduced to evoke laughter
from a modern music-hall audience. lt was scarcely necessary for
Lambinus to quote three Latin authors in proosof this physiological
fact3 for literary references to it cf. Aristoph. Rau. 418 ; Juv. xiv. 10
cum septimus amens T ransz'ert't puerum, nondum omni deute renato.
