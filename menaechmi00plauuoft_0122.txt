NOTES

ARGVMENTVM. Aulus Gellius (iii. 3. 1) mentions one Aurelius
Opilius (84 Β. C.) as the author of Plautine ‘ indices ', which may be
identified with the acrostic arguments extant in the Palatine group
of MSS. for all the plays except the Bacchides. In any case the
acrostic arguments are probably to be ascribed to the period of the
revival of Plautine studies, 150—50 Β. c. Non-acrostic arguments
are also attached to five of the plays (Amph, Aul„ Mera, Mil„
Pseud.) 3 they date from the second century A. D., and have been
ascribed to a Carthaginian scholar who wrote metrical arguments to
the books of the Aenez'd and the plays of Terence.

construction ε cf. prol. 57—9 Epidamniensis ill' . . . εί liberorum . . .

1. quoi: cf. aliquoi 623. This is the usual spelling in inscrip-
tions of the late Republic and early Empire. Quintilian, who lived
during the first century A. D., says (i. 7. 27) that in his younger days
the spelling quoi was the rule, but that later the practice arose of
writing1 cui. The earliest form was quoiei3 cf. 493 quoii. Scan

2. surrupto: this Plautine form of the participle arises from
confusion with the present, which was in O.Lat. written surripio or
surrupio, unaccented d becoming before labials an indeterminate
sound‚ written z· or u. The later form appears below in surrepticius
(3, 7), sor which Plautus writes surrupticias, Curc. 205 ; cf. Prol.
60, 68.

Hiatus at a caesura (as in this line and the next) is not as such
permissible ; see Introd. 7. IV. C. b, p. 53.

e, ‘ aster being'‚ i. e. ‘ instead of’.

7. alitus: this form is found once in Livy, and perhaps is to be
read in Cic. Plane. 81.

8. Menaechmum . . . ciuem: predicative. The hiatus is faulty.

9. eumque appellant, sc. ilsenaeclcmmu ; or perhaps = ⁶ accost
him ⁹.

used as a common noun, signified, according to Festus, either
