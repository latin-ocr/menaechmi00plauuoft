amusing (see V. iii-v). He represents a type not yet extinct.
The scolding wife, the parasite, the courtesan, and the grey-

collected by Aulus Gellius. He is said to have migrated to the

stage-carpenter‚ an employment which enabled him to save
a little money, and doubtless turned his attention towards his
true me'tier. His small nest-egg, however, vanished as the
result of a rash investment, and he was reduced to such straits
as to seek employment with a miller as a common labourer.
His duty consisted in working a treadmill‚ and it has been
conjectured that hence he derived that deformity of the feet
which, according to Festus, won him the nickname of Plautus
(Flatsoot). As the word, however, is Umbrian, it was more
