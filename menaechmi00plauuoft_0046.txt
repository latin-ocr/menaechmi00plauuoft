42 INTRODUCTION

in the instances given below; but impartial examination will
show that in the great majority of these instances the ictus
falls on a syllable bearing word· or sentence-aecem, i. e. a
syllable which would bc stressed in ordinary conversation.
One further warning: in what follows the terms long and
short are, sor convenience' sake, used in the ordinary way,

i. e. of syllables which Augustan poets treated as long and
short respectively.

Ι. Shortening of Long Syllables.

A. A long syllable may be (and commonly is) scanned as
short if the preceding syllable is short and bears ictus ¹

(a) in disyllabic words (including words of three syllables
made disyllabic by elision), an iambus being thus weakened
to a pyrrhic:

(i) when the vowel of the final syllable is either long by
position or long by both position and nature, as 16 ddzstl
benzglrzt'tas3 208 cipdd tel, cs. 795, 10343 351 ςῖηέ ,ὥνέςὶςιῖὶ
689 dssdistt’ &lam 3 786 mi Ι ρἅἔν, edulereg 860 ἕνιῖηι u5!ro;
389 ffgbn ΐὲ Ι, cf. 653 3 828 uf'dffn tu illlic3 527 mmm Ι recen-l
cinnalrier (though perhaps this is an instance of synizesis 3
cf. 542, and see ΙΙ. e. below).

(ii) when the word ends in a long vowel 3 chiefly in the case
of imperatives, as 179-80 φηᾶηέ, 416 ἰάίὲ, 517 ι’ΐιῶἔ, 934, 994
caua 225 νὲἅῖ.

(b) in word-groups wherein an iambus occurs: more de-
finitely, when a word of one short syllable (or a word of two
syllables of which the first is short and the second elided) is

followed by a word forming or beginning with a long syllable
having a vowel or lc as its first letter, this long‘syllable is com-
monly treated as short when the preceding short syllable bears
ictus¹: as 222 {go §t Affnjaeclzmus, cf. 10093 530 scin qui'd

dg Arhd, tthergfore, word· or sentence-aecem also (according to the view
a pte a ove.
