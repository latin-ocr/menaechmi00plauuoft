COMMENTARY: LINES ὄπι-38

inpune non erit, sc. illis.

nugas agis, ‘ you’re talking nonsensc', or ‘you're making
a fool of yourself‘. The pitiless repetition of this answer to
each os Men.'s hypocritical questions would be effective on the
stage.

622. tristis . . . est: as if talking to himself in great concern.
One MS. reads es. tristis = ‘ upset ’.

non . . . sati', ‘ not at all '.

623. familiarium, ‘ of the household ’.

’ὄζῳ n>um . . . saltem? ‘ at any rate you’re surely not angry
wit me . ’

d 626. mea uxor : Men. now tries endearments ; hence blan-
itur.
bellus, ‘ the pretty fellow '‚ ‘ your fine husband ¹.

627. num te appello? ‘amI talking to you?' Men. tries to
silence the parasite, and at the same time, in the hope of dividing
the hostile forces, attempts to caress his wife ς hence auser manum ;
cf. Amph. 903 (Alcmena to Jupiter) patin ut aps-lineas manum ?

628. sic datur: see note on 604, and cf. 472.

d properato: ironical exhortation: ‘now go and . . .’ So deri-
eto, 629.
comesse ε infin. pres. of comedo, representing original comed-e-
se. Cf. comesses (imperf. subj.), 611.
630. huc: pointing to Erotium's house.
633. Scan mz⁶lti esse: see Introd. 7. 1. A. b, pp. 42—3.
sinciput: cf. 506.
634. negabas: sc. te; cf. 482, 538, διε.
aibas: cf. Amph. 8073 Asin. 208, &c.; contrast 532 above,
aiebas. The regular termination of the fourth-conjugation imperf.
indic. was originally -i-bam (-bam being connected with the root fu-
seen in sui); the form in -iebam, originally regular in verbs of the
facio class, was extended by false analogy to fourth—conjugation
verbs. See also note on scibo, 386.

635. ut = postquam. ‘ why, it's only now at last that I⁷m getting
back horne after parting with you a while ago.’

636. noui ego te : referring back to 634 negabas me nouisse, but
with secondary meaning, ⁴ 1 know what your word is worth ⁹.

qui: instr. ablative: ‘ you didn’t think 1 had the power' (or,
perhaps, ‘ the spirit') ‘to pay you out ’.

638. eam ipsus [i] roga: see App. Crit. z' is bracketed here (as
by Ritschl‚ who reads eampse* 1 nigri ; perhaps rightly, as the sense
required is ‘ask her ’) on the ground that the three speakers were
standing close together; but i is sometimes used contemptuously
without reference to actual motion; cf. Verg. Aen. ix. 634 i, uerbis
uirtutem inlude superbis; in this use i nunc (et) . . . is very
common3 cf. Ovid, Her. iii. 26 i nunc et cupidi nomen amantis
habe. Omitting i, scan e‘am {hstis 1 rogd qui‘d Ι lto‘c ἔπη retainmg
