MENAECHMI

294. The spondaic word in the fourth foot expresses pain'ed
surprise3 cf. the sanie in a similar passage, 499.

295. sei . . . seu : this, instead of siue (seu) . . . siue (seu) is the
usual combination in Plautus.

k Coriendru’s: suggested by coriandrum, a seed used to flavour
ca ’es.

perieris: a wisli; this tense is used partly because the meaning
required is ‘may you be completely confounded’, and partly because
the perf. subj. in e-r’zm was originally an optative form, just as the
fut. perf. in -e70 wasasubjunctive. Cf. Cas. 399 αἐῖιᾳιιενιᾝί

297. tantum with quom . . . nomine 298.

quod sciam: limitative, ‘ as far as 1 know ' 3 the antecedent of
quod is an adverbial acc. understood. Cf. 500.

298. pro sano: cf. 927 hau pro insano.

299. nouisti ; here aorist, not perfect as in 294. 296; ‘ where did
you make my acquaintance ? ' Cf. 337, 501.

ubi . . . nouerim: sc quaeris? the subj. is usual when a
question is thus echoed.

300. Scan qu? dmfcjcmm see Introd. 7. 1V. A. a. ii, p. 51.

302. Scan tfb2‘; so 323, 439, &c.

303. cyathiss0‚‘ fill your glass' ; the cyathus was a ladle sor
transferring wine from the crater to the poculum. From Greek
κυαθίζως for the termination cf. graecissat, &c. 11—12.

. quando temporal is used by the comic dramatists of indefinite
tune.
ὲῖῑ an interjection.

304. quom nihil est: generally speaking, Plautus uses quom
causal with the indicative when the reason given is a plain sact3
cf.'Capt. 995 eheu, quom ego . . . feci. See also 309 note.

qui: instrumental ablative; cf. 452, 636, 743.

illic: dative, = illi—ce, as in 828, 841.

dimminuam : this verb is used by the comic dramatists in the
phrases dimminnere (= disminuere) caput or cerebrum; cf. Most.
266, Ter. Ad. 571.

307. in illisce aedibus: pointing to the house of Menaech-
mus 1.

308. illi[c]: either illi (adv.) must be written for illic, or we
must read with Seyffert lmbe's for habitas (cf. 69). Onions suggests
da· illum omnes, qui illic habitat, perduint, on the ground that
onmes has been corrupted to homines (as often), and illum and
lzabz'lat altered accordingly: this certainly suitsNthe next line
better.

309. Scan ΜεΙᾳῐιῖιίὲυι qui fplse. This line is an aside3 the cook
dares not call Men. mad, except in a roundabout way, 310—315.
Cf. 282 note.

qui . . . dicit: eontrast 313 qui . . . dicas. Plautus seems to
use indic. and subj. impartially after a causal relative; cf. Poen.
