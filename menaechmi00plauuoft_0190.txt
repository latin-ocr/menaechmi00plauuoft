MENAECHMI

regi: a flattering title often bestowed by a cliens upon his
patronum cf. A sin. 919 ; Ter. Plzorm. 338 3 used here also in allusion -
to Agamemnon. Scan 5W3 cf. nze—o 905.

903. Scan unm Ego* l Ιιὸιηῖηᾱηι ; to avoid these hiatuses,
Miiller inserts lwdz'e (frequent in threats) before hominem 3 but for
hiatus after pyrrhic not bearing ictus cf. 1061, and see Introd. 7.
IV. Β. a. ii. p. 53 : the first hiatus is quite regular.

si . . . uiu0; ‘ as sure as I’m alive' ; cf. Aul. 573 3 Bacch. 7663
Pseud. 1325. The future si uiuam is also used in this form of
asseveration‚ as Most. 4. The apodosis is always in the future.
Cf. the similar variation between si sapis and si sapies. Note the
alliteration.

euoluam, ‘ unwrap from ⁸, and so ‘ strip of’.

904. illius esse: sc. uitam ; referring to uita . . . sua, 903. The
point of this line lies in the double meaning of uita (life, livelihood) 3
Menaechmus says in effect: ‘The meals he consumeS‚ which to
him are uita, are really mine3 I’ll deprive him of his sole possession,
namely‚ the breath he draws.'

905. educatust.- cf. 98.

906.6c0ndigne, ‘just as badly’‚ i.e. as Peniculus3 used similarly
Aul. 4 5.

907. palla: outside its clause, and therefore emphatic. Men.1
knows that the palla is a sore point with Erotium, though he is
ignorant of the real cause of her annoyance.

908. Scan ez} Ι ἔιῖὲβᾶί J Ι nb egro.

uiuo : emphatic for sum3 cf. 202. Or perhaps : ⁶ It‘s a
wretched life I lead.'

909. The Senex and the Doctor have thus far remained hidden
(cf. 898), but catch Men.’s last words. After this brief conversation
aside, they suddenly advanee to Men„ to whom the doctor is known
(cf. 9 ).

5507 miserum praedicat: a symptom of melancholia.

910. qur . . . bracchium ἱ) Men. has accompanied his last words
(908) with a gesture of declamation‚ and so displaced his robe.

911. nunc tuo : not redundant with isti, but = ‘ which you're now
suffering from ’.

mali with quantum.

912. quin . . . suspendis? Men„ already in a state of high
irritability owing to his mysterious misfortunes‚ naturally treats this
new nuisance with impatient rudeness‚ which is regarded as a further
proof of derangement. ’Ὗ

ecquid sentis ¹? ‘ do you notice anything (wrong with him)?’
Hildyard ingeniously suggests that the doctor, under cover of
shaking hands, or perhaps under pretence of putting Men.’s robe
straight (910), has surreptitiously felt Men.’s pulse; and that the
Senex, perceiving the manoeuvre, asks: ‘do you gather anything
(from the state of his pulse)?’ This would make excellent sense,
