MODERN DERIVATIVES ²5

both with the Menaechmi and with the Comedy will afford both
instruction and entertainment.¹

Three plays produced subsequently to the Comedy call for
brief mention. Towards the end of his life, about 1705, the
F rench comic dramatist Regnard produced a play entitled Les
Menechmes ou les Jumeaux. Its plot was derived from the
Menaechmi, but the handling is weak and the dialogue frothy.
Another adaptation appeared in Holland, where De Gelyke
Twe‘lingen was acted at Amsterdam about 1715. Lastly‚ about
the middle of the eighteenth century, Carlo Goldoni, a Venetian
by birth and the founder of modern Italian Comedy, pro-
duced a play based upon the Menaechmi entitled I due gemelli
Veneziani, which was, however, one of his less important pieces.
It is curious to note that the plot of the Menaechmi has been
utilized by several pioneers of changes in the comic drama—
Hercules of Ferrara, Bibbiena, Shakespeare, Goldoni. It may
be said, in conclusion, that none of the imitators of this play,
save only our own poet, improved upon their original.

6. METRES

I (a). The metres employed by Plautus and Terence are
borrowed from Greek dramatic poetry. Since Latin was
a stressed, while Greek was an unstressed‚ language,² these
metres in most cases required modification before they could
be adapted to the Latin tongue. If we accept a theory which
every fresh investigation tends to strengthen‚³ it was the excep-
tion in Roman comic drama for ictus (verse-beat) to conflict
with accent (word-stress); but, if the Greek metres had been
reproduced therein without modification, such conflict must
very frequently have occurred. By way of illustration let the
Iambic Trimeter be taken. The Greek poets treated this
