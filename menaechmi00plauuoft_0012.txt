8 INTRODUCTION

recognition scene is lengthened out far beyond the bounds of
probability.

On the other hand these improbabilities are postulated by
the incidents which form the staple of the play3 and, granted
those improbabilities, they follow necessarily. The weakness of
the plot, therefore, detracts but little from the merit of the
play, the excellence os which lies first in its atmosphere of high
spirits, comic roguery, and perplexed bewilderment‚ and ι
secondly in its skilful if not subtle characterization. The horse—
play of Ι. ii, the supposed madman's antics in V. ii, and the
scuffle with the lorariz' in V. vii, would doubtless tickle the
schoolboy-like fancy of the average Roman spectator3 scenes
like the baiting of Menaechmus of Epidamnus by his wife and
the parasite (IV. ii), or the doctor's cross-examination of his
patient (V. v), have a slightly more intellectual appeal 3 and such
episodes as the Syracusan's cunning evasion of the results of
his own mistakes (418-21, 531—7), or his brother’s assumption
of injured innocence, culminating in his childlike and bland
Quis is Menaechmust? (651), are irresistibly humorous.

Of the characters in the play, the two Menaechmi are merely
a pair of sels-indulgent rogues; if any distinction is to be
drawn between them, perhaps Menaechmus of Syracuse is the
robuster villain. This difference seems to have been noted and
developed in the Comeassv of Errors by Shakespeare, whose
Antipholus of Syracuse offers a strong contrast to the solemn
and cantankerous Antipholus of Ephesus. Shakespeare has
also drawn upon the characteristics of Messenio for his portrait
of the younger Dromio twin. Just as the latter is a soil for his
master, so Messenio, in comparison with Menaechmus of
Syracuse, is a model of propriety (cf. 258 seq., s3ng45) and of
self-satisfied respectability (cf. V. vi). The last scene of the
play would be tedious but for the pompous fussiness with
which Messenio conducts the investigation. Of the remaining
characters, the Physician is perhaps the most skilfully drawn,
