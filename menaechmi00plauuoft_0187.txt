COMMENTARY: LINES 858-82

from attacking Agamemnon ; cf. llom. ll. i. 197 στῆ δ’ ὄπιθεν
ξανθῆς δὲ κόμης ἕλε Πηλείωνα. Finding he cannot frighten away the
Senex, Men. adopts the device of falling down in an assumed fit;
at the same time he maintains his rOle of madman by pretending to
attribute his sensations to supernatural agency.

871. tuom . . . Apollinis: the genitive stands in apposition to
the possessive pronoun (which is equivalent to a genitive); cf. Cic.
Phil. ii. 43. 111 tuum hominis simplicis pectus ; Eur. Hec. 430
θανούσης ὄμμα συγκλήσει τὸ σόν. It is used here partly sor emphasis,
and partly metri gratia. Mean voice gradually grows sainter
as he delivers this line, and at the end of it he collapses.

872—3. Most edd. mark a lacuna as in text; it is supposed that
some generality has dropped out (e. g. N iem. suggests ita nunc lu'c
iacet Aliser. nihilist uita hominum) which is illustrated by the
particular example introduced by uel (‘s0r instance') in ll. 873³-4·
But surely eu . . . durum is itself agenerality ; there is no need either
to mark a lacuna or to adopt the faulty scansions criticized in the App.
Crit. if we read with Hare : eu morbum hercle acrem ac durum J di,
nostram fidem! Vel hic, &02 ‘ 'Gad‚ how violent and severe a
disease (this madness is) ! Heaven protect us (from it) 2 (Look at)
this poor madman, sor instance—how strong he was a little while
agol' A further objection to the present text of 1. 872 is that
stress is thrown on ac.

87 3⁸. uel = ‘ for instance ’ ; cf. 1042 ; Ter. Hec. 60 ; Cic. ad Fam.
ii. 13. 1 sed suauis accipio litteras, uel quas proxime acceperam,
quam prudentes!

87 5. Here exit the Senex; but the break between scenes should
come at 881, where see note. ι

877. ut ualidus insaniam 2> neither the accentuation udlzdas nor
the scansion ualidas can be justified (see, however, note on 841) :
longffis, 327, is no parallel, as its final syllable was originally long.
See App. Crit. Brix⁹s suggestion improves sense and mette ; with
Bothe s proposal uesaniam cf. his proposal uesania (subst.) 921 ;
but neither verb nor substantive is found in the Dramatist53 the
verb, indeed, appears once only in Catullus ; nowhere else before the
sixth century A. D. -

879—81. For the comic device of a direct appeal to the spectators
cf. 1000, 1157; Amph. 376; Aul. 406, 715-20; Cist. 678; Most.
280—1‚ ἃς. It is a favourite trick of Aristophanes ; cf. Vesp. 74 seq.
where actors distributed among the audience take part in the dia-
logue, as in a modern Revue. .

881. For ni = ni see note on 419-20. Here Men. II goes off R.,
just before Senex, returning from the doctor’s‚ enters L. ; the
break between scenes should therefore occur here. See Introd. 4,

8¹82. sedendo . . . spectando: i.e. waiting in the consulting-
room, and looking out to see whether the doctor was coming: the
