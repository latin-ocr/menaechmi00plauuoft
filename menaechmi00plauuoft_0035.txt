(d) In the AIenaecltmi Iambic Octonarii occur either in
Cantica proper (eg. κει-2, ιεδ-ῳ, 131-2, 986-7) or in lively
passages of recitative (quasi-Cantica3 see Introd. 4) such as
995—1005, 1060-2.

(e) As specimens of this metro in English may be nicu-
tioned Campbell’s Holeenlinden aud Byron’s illazeppa.

D. The Trochaic Septenarius (= Greek Trochaic Tetra-
meter Catalectic).

(a) This is a line of seven aud a half feet, whercof each
complete foot is either a trochee (—' υ) or some foot reckoned
as the metrical equivalent of a trochee and permitted as a sub-
stitute therefor.

(b) In every complete foot except the fourth and severith
Plautus freely allows such substitutes ; namely, the tribrach
(ό υ υ, the only exact metrical equivalent) 3 the spondee¹
(—‘ —) 3 and the metrica] equivalents of the spondee, naniely
the dactyl (-‘ υ o), the anapaest (ό υ -), and (rarely) the pro-
celeusmatic (ό υ o o).

(c) It is a general rule, to which there are very few excep-
tions, that a diaeresis must occur between the fourth soot and
the fifth. In this case the line must be regarded as falling into
two ‘hemistichs to the extent that the fourth foot must be a
trochee or its sole exact metrical equivalent, a tribrach3 and
may be so regarded to the extent that hiatus may occur at the
diaeresis² and that syllaba anceps may occur at the end of the
fourth foot (i. e. in the fourth foot a spondee may be reckoned
as a trochee, and an anapaest as a tribrach). The practical
result is that before a diaeresis any substitute for the trochee
may be allowed except a dactyl ³ or a proceleusmatic.

² How the spondee could be regarded as a metrical equivalent of the
trochee has been explained above, I. (c).

² For examples of such hiatus, which is very common, see Introd.
7'31th}aapparent exception in 152 may be due to the elision at the end of
the fourth foot there, which renders the diaeresis impure; but the line is
corrupt.
