THE STAGING OF THE PLAY 21

by γνῶμαι or sententious maxims scattered through the play
(e. g. 87-8, 193, 249); and, in respect of the Parabasis, as has
been mentioned, by the Prologue.

The strict dramatic rule nec quarta loqui persona laboret
(Hor. A. P. 192) was disregarded on the comic stage 3 thus for
the Menaechmi at least five actors (apart from κωφὰ πρόσωπα

history of the stage, alive to the humorous possibilities of a
plot based upon the errors arising from mistaken identity, is

fragments by writers of New and Middle Greek Comedy are
extant. The mediaeval drama contains numerous instances of
comedies with a similar plot-basis; and, passing on to the
beginnings of the modern world, we find that, in Elizabethan
stage parlance‚ the name ‘ Errors ' was attached to comedies of
this stamp as a kind of generic term, from which we may infer
that they were not uncommon. In our own day, too, we have
seen numbers of ephemeral farces wherein such ‘Errors'
afforded the flimsy substratum of a so-called plot.

Os direct imitations of the Menaechmi there are, on the
other hand, comparatively few. Hercules Ι, Duke of Ferrara
at the end of the fifteenth century, had Italian versions of
plays by Plautus and Terence performed at his court 3 among
them was I illenecmt', produced in 1486. The earliest regular
comedies, having any claim to originality of treatment, per-

Europe) were the plays of Cardinal Bibbiena. His Calandra,
