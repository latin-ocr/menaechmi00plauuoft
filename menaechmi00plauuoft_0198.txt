MENAECHMI

omission of auxiliary in a dependent clause, cf. 119 ul facturus
dicam. Perhaps the best suggestion, as being closest to the MSS., is
promeriti, tum qui metuont! ⁶ how srightened they are then! ’
Scan mamm prffi.

984. metuam hau multum: the sense seems to require an
emphatic ego here. Possibly therefore Hermann is right in rejecting
9832'b as an interpolation from Mosf. 858-61; if those two lines
are omitted, mel. lmu mult. will be apodosis to adhibeam in 983
(culp. apsl. in that case also being protasis),·with the meaning
‘1 shall have little cause for anxiety’.

prope est quiinldo : cf. Ter. Andr. 152jn¹0pe adest cum aliena
more uiuendumst milzi. This line is an anapaestic tetrameter
catalectic, 982—3b being acatalectic.

quando †ceruso faciam†: the initial c of cerusa following —0
of quando probably conceals lzoc (agreeing with prelium), which
gives good sense if taken as referring to metuam hau multum:
⁶ this reward ’, namely, immunity from the cares and anxieties of
slavery, i.e. manumission; cf. 1148. With regard to the rest of
the puzzle, Lindsay's suggestion (see App. Crit.) qmtnldo laic bras Ι
quaifci'cz'jam (= pro eis quaesaciam) entails a rather harsh ellipse.
Bothe, on the ground that -m is osten added wrongly to a word in
MSS. (cf. MSS. readings in Mil. 58, 154, 236-8), suggests (ibfctcsstct
ῄνέίιᾙιυι ἔχς-; but this would give a tribrach (which cannot stand
for an anapaest) in the sixth soot. Possibly -osaciam of the MSS.
(or —osatiam, as some read it) conceals the word optatum.

985. (eo) . . . exemplo (= strong ita), ‘after this fashion ⁹,

explained by tergo ut . . . arbitror.

seruio, ‘ perform my (servile) duties ⁹.

tergo: dative of advantage, cf. Ter. Andr. 546; Merula reads
serg& for genitive or equivalent with in rem esse cf. Trin. 6283
Pers. 342; Ter. Hec. 102.

986. nassa, ‘ our traps’; cf. Livy xxi. 47. 2 uasa colllgere (os
military baggage). ·

ut iusserat qualifies ita uenio adum-sum, for which phrase see
437 note. Mess. thinks that his master is still in Erotium’s house.

988. †neque utrum† ε Brix formerly read alque eum, after
Gronovius3 N iem„ with Bothe, prefers atque uirum (cf. his uiro
for utro, 188, quoted in note on 183); Ritschl, meumque erum.
One is tempted to suggest reque uirum, or reque ut eum (colloquial
repetition of ul, as in Capt. 248): i.e. re . . . salumn (sc. si non
animo), ‘with purse (if not heart) intact ἐ cf. Truc. 46ᾞε> (47 esp).
Mess. must have momentarily forgotten that lte has the purse (cf. 386,
. 701) ; otherwise the metaphor in this line and the next is pointless.

saltu damni: i.e. Erotium's house; cf. 133, and Trin. 314
damni conciliabulum, used in a similar connexion. Saltus is
properly used of a mountain pass or forest ride, such as affords good
ambush sor brigands ς cf. the metaphor of the pirate-ship, 344, 442.
