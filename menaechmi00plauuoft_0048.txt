C. The first syllables of certain frequently occurring demon-
stratives (esp. ille and iste) are normally treated as short,
though scanned as long when the words are used emphatically.
Employed in conversation much in the same way as our
articles, they were normally unaccentuated‚ and tended to lose
the unflexed and therefore unimportant first syllable (ef.
French le, la, les = illum -am -os, δερ.) Instances falling under
this head are, as will readily be observed, merely special cases
of A. (b) or B. (b), as :

(a) when ictus falls on a preceding short (or shortened)
syllable (cf. A. b): 22 12! quidem ῖίΙίε, cf. 3363 604 ηέ illam
ἔΙεαςίον, cf. 8373 606 quzhd miic j, cf. 682, 789, 958, 962, 9973

(b) when the preceding syllable is short and the succeeding
syllable bears ictus (ef. B. b) : 23 Ego ἵίίόςΙ, cf. 41, 46, 246, 535 3
536 abi Illae drlmillae3 853 har} mdle icllti'nc, 'cf. 861, 9943 94

Similarly with eccum, &c. (cf. French celui = ecce illum), as 275
ςέιί ἔζη-ἕνη, 565 sZ’d Eccc‘z‘m. A good instance of the contrast
between the emphatic and the ordinary treatment of such
words occurs in Mil. 972 si J'llcz uolt )( 973 quz⁹d illci' faciemus
concubind 2, where illd is merely an article.

D. Final -s following a short vowel may in some cases ,
be disregarded in scansion: ¹

(a) before an initial consonant, in disyllaffles with the
first syllable short. Here the disregard of the final -s re-
produees the rapid pronunciation of an iambic word ac-
cented on the first syllable and ending in -s. Instances

¹ It is frequently disregarded by Ennius and Lucretius.
