MENAECHMI

947. quid facias optumumst? lit. ‘what you must do, it's
best ?' i.e. ‘ what you had best do ? ' The arrangement is paratactic‚
as usually with optumum est, the subjunctive being jussive; see
note on 831, and cf. Asin. 4483 Epid. 59 ; Aul. 567 tum tu idem
optumumst Loces ecferendum ; similarly with insumul, Bacch. 994
(MSS.) ; certumst, Aul. 676.

948. ad me, ‘ to my house‘3 50 also 952, 956.

face uti deteratur: more commonly ut is omitted, e-g. 890
ac sczam.
s quippini? = quippe ni (i. e. quippe non, see 912 note; sor the
weakening of the vowel see note on seruirin 795) has the same
sense as quidni, but is rarely followed by a verb, while the latter
rarely stands without one 3 cf. 912, 1109.

949. meo arbitratu, ‘just as I please' ; cs. 91.

950. aliquos gives a tone of vagueness to the phrase, as we say
‘some three weeks’ cf, Pseud. 321 ut opperiar& lzos sex dzes
aliquos (but laos without alzquos generally refers to past time;
cf. 104 laos dzes multos): the usage is colloquial; cf. Cic. m' Att. ἰν.
46. 1 ueltm mi'lzz mztlas de tuzs li'brarzolz's duos alzqzcos. Warner
translates here: ‘Oh‚ Sir, Ι will make yee take neesing powder
this twentie dayes ' (cf. German Nieswurs' = hellebore); to which
Men. answers: ‘Ile beate yee first with a bastanado this thirtie
da es.’

2351. pendentem: when slaves were flogged they were some-
times suspended to a beam by the hands, a weight being attached
to their seet3 see the locus classicus, Asin. 303-5. The object os
this detestable cruelty was to prevent their struggling. Men.’s
threat is an insult‚ as it implies that the physician is a slave;
many physicians in Rome actually were slav es, and, if skilful or
popular, were a source of great profit to their masters.

953. promde ut: li.t ‘in proportion as’ tr. ‘considering the
degree (violence) of madness 1 perceive (in him)'.

954. immo: corrective. The doctor is ready with a plausible
excuse.

955. quibu’ paratis: sor abl. of passive partic. with a pronoun
in agreement after opus est, cf. Pers. 584 opusnest hac tibi empta?
50 perhaps with usus est, 753. where see note.

956. ferant: for paratactic subjunctive with zubco cf. llost. 930
cur‘rzculo tube m urbem τιεηιαί; Rud. 7083 50 syntactic subj-
(introd. by ut), Amph. 2053 (alone), Epzssd 627.

illic— = apud te. Ὗ

Scan erit ; cf. 921 percipit, and note. Perhaps syllaba anceps.

The Senex and the Doctor now exeunt. Men„ not suspecting
what is in store for him, since ll. 946-9 and 952—6 have been spoken
out of his hearing, decides to remain where he is (965).
