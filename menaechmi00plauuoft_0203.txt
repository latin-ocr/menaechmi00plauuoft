COMMENTARY: LINES 1019-41

(1036, 1043, marsuppium), and wrongly replaced here, also owing
to homoeoteleuton (1029, 1044), as well as restored to their original
position ; see 1041-2⁸, note.

1029. πιέἴι . . . caussa: cf. 727.

liber esto: the formula of manumission; cs. 1148, note.

1030. nemp’ iubes '? the verb is emphatic ; ‘ do you really order

me (to be sree)?’ i. e. :is master.

imperi . . . in te: cs. lior. Od. iv. 4. 2 cui rex deorum regnum
in aues uagas permisit. Possibly le· is abl. ; cs. Mil. 611 (MSS).
Messenio takes siquid . . . milei as strengthening iubeo.

1031. patrone: the manumitted slave was the cliens os his old
master. Messenio adapts himself to the new conditions at once;
cf. 1032, 1033 sui.

1031-2. ‘quom tu liber es . . . gaudeo': Messenio imagines
himself returned home and receiving the congratulations os his
fellow·s1aves; cf. the actual congratulations he receives, 1148. For
a similar imaginary scene cf. Alere. 946-50. quom, when used
thus as equivalent to quod, ‘whereas ¹ (after gaudeo, δια, cf. 1148;
Elpid. 711), is generally regarded as an old neuter sing. (acc.) of the
re ative.

1032. eredo . . . uobis: Messenio's imaginary answer to the
imaginary congratulations. Credo was the conventional answer to
such congratulations ; cf. Ter. Ad. 972, Andr. 939, 946—7.

1034. domum : i. e. to Syracuse. where his real master lived.

1035. minime : spoken aside. Men. had had enough of clientes.

1036. opsignatum: in the absence os locks and keys os the
modern diversity of pattern‚ householders guarded against pilsering
on the part os slaves by affixing seals to bags, chests‚ cupboard5‚
and even wine-jars.

1038. reddiboz cf. Cas. 129; this form of the future seems to
indicate an original distinction between —do = δίδωμι and -do=
τίθημιε the original future of reddo in the sense ‘give back’ may
have been red-dabo, which by natural weakening of the unstressed
syllable would become re‘ddz'bo. Mess. here exit, leaving Men. to
meditate on the strange vagaries os fortune he has experienced.

1039. nimia mira, ‘very strange occurrences’3 cf. Amph. 616,
1105 ; Cas. 625 tanta mira.

· 1041—22. The true reading in these lines is very doubtful; the
difficulty os restoring the original is increased by the fact that
ll. 1037-43 appear in Ρ twice, (a) between 1028 and 1029, and (b)
in their present place, and that differences of reading occur between
the lines as given in the first place and as given in the second:
the readings os the two passages will be hereaster referred to
as (a) and (b) respectively. It is reasonable to suppose that the
passage had been omitted in some early copy owing to homoeo-
teleuton, marsuppium being the last word in both 1036 and 1043 (sor
the same reason 1044 appears in P after both 1036 and 1043), and
