and give additional point to Men.’s exclamation. Hildyard quotes
Tac. Anu. vi. 50 medicus . . . per speciem efficii manum complexus
pulsum uenarum arhga).

quidni sentiam ’ἶ ‘ os course 1 do ' ; quidni (-m' = nei, i. e. n?
in the Ο. Lat. sense of non) is thus used in answers with the verb
ofthe question repeated in the corresponding tense os the subjunctive
(potential); cf. Mil, 923; normally in tmesi, as Mil. 1120 Ργ.
ιἸαη tu censes ,ἰ ΡΑ. quid ego ni ita censeam ‚2 So frequently cur uon ?
Cf. quippini? 948.

9ι3. ellebori iungere: (ι) the correction of 13², unguine, is
accepted by Wagner and by Brix-Niem.; but hellebore, the
traditional remedy for madness, was administered in the form of
a draught, not of an ointinent; cf. 921 potionis, 950 elleborum
potabis; Hor. Epp. ii. 2. 1373 Pers. iv. 163 Auson. Ep. 4. 69
Anticyramue bihe53 Aristoph. Vesp. 1489 πῖθ’ ἑλλέβορον. (2) The
rest of the MSS. give iungere, which Lindsay retains (supposing a
nom. iungus= ζεῦγος), apparently in the sense of ‘mixture' (i. e.
containing hellebore) ; but ζεῦγος nowhere occurs with this meaning.
(3) Scholl proposes iumento in the sense of ‘ wagon-load ’ (cf. Plato,
Euthyd. 229 Β ἐλλεβόρου ἅμαξα) ; but iumentum is nowhere else so
used, and even iugum and quadrzgae, though they sometimes
mean ‘ wagon' or ‘chariot', are never like ἅμαξα used in the
sense of ‘load’. (4) Leo’s suggestion, with the same meaning,
uno onere, is better. (5) The conjectures iugero (Sonnenschein)
and ingere (Ital., from a supposed heteroclitic singular of iugerum)
give the best sense (‘ an acre os hellebore’), and require a very
slight alteration only of the MSS.; the error may have arisen
through dittography of u.

optinerier, ‘ managed '.
915. atrum : Italian natural wine was very dark.
quin tu is, &c.: this line is quoted with a different ending in
a note on Curc. 242 by a later hand found in the margin of B ; see
App. Crit. The words suggested by Lindsay may easily have dropped
out through similarity to the beginning of this line.

916. As it stands in the MSS. this line will not scan; it can be
made metrical by bracketing tu (see App. Crit.) and scanning
primamne. Vahlen and Scholl mark a lacuna, which Niem. fills
thus: primdlzim. <quin tu milti [Ι id respondes quod rogaui .?>
MEN. quin tu me(d> interrogas, ἃς. Some such words may
have dropped out owing to quin tu occurring near the end of three
consecutive lines. On the scansion prinzzilzim see Introd. 7. 1. E.d.

insanire primulum, ‘to show the first faint signs of a (coming)
fit of raving'; cf. 921, 934.
917. purpureum . . . puniceum, ‘ dark-red . . . bright red ’.
esse: cs. 628 comesse. The original form was ed-(e)-se; cf.
surrexe, Hor„ which is strictly a present, not a perfect, infinitive.
lfiteum: from latum, ‘yellow-weed' )(l12leus from latum, ‘ mud ⁹.
