387 firmus, cf. 422, 1 154: (ii) 885 AEl (so frequently).

111. Lengthening of Short syllables.

Certain terminations, among which may here be noted
conjugation-endings in -z‘s‚ -at, -et, -it, and comparative-endings
-or, -us, were originally of long quantity3 influence of accent
gradually weakened the value of these final syllables until,
by the time of the Augustan poetS, they were almost invariably
treated as short before an initial vowel. In Plautus's time they
were in the final stage of transition, and their treatment as short
by nature was the rule3 yet under the influence of metrical

ictus the original long quantity was occasionally retained by the
comic dramatists3 more rarely, an indisputably short syllable
was thus lengthened. It will be seen that this suffix-lengthen-
ing occurs often before a pause and invariably in syllables
bearing ictus : e. g.

(a) conjugation-endings : 943 ἐς ἑΙφΙιὶςςιις (es is always scanned
as long by Plautus and Terence) 3 487 und ἄῗς, Ι Ιιῦηιό (probably
a word-group common in conversation) 3 1 101 emerli's cirlgento 3
203 decsse‘t dnilmatos 3 52 uait, Ι αιιᾱαεΙίεν <at pause) 3 759 quom
