32 INTRODUCTION

(d) In'the rare cases where there is no such diaeresis, any of
the substitutes mentioned in (b) is allowed in the fourth foot.

(e) The seventh foot must be either a trochee or a tribrach.

(f) A dactyl is seldom followed by an anapaest: see A. (c)
above.

(g) A proceleusmatic is rare except in the first and fifth (i.e.
the first foot of each hemistich). In this play, however, pro-
celeusmatics occur twice in the second foot (618, 957), as well
as in the fifth (1069).

(h) The final half-foot consists of a single syllable, long or
short (syllaba anceps).

(i) With the exceptions mentioned in A. (f)—where the rule
is explained—the line may not end with two iambic words,
though endings of the permissible mala‘m—crucem type occur
osten, e.g. 915, 1017.

(j) This is the metre ordinarily employed in passages of
lively narrative or excited dialogue delivered in recitative (quasi-
Cantica: see Introd. 4). More than half the Menaechmi is
written in Trochaic Septenarii. It is curious that the first four
continuous passages are of 97 lines each.

(k) In English this metre is frequently employed in comic
verse3 eg.

Many a Ι stately Ι home he's Ι entered, ΙΙ bilt, with Ι duob-l
trtisive Ι tact,

He has Ι ne'er, in Ι paying Ι visits, ΙΙ called atitention Ι to the Ι
fact.

E. The Trochaic octonarius (= Greek Trochaic Tetra-
meter Acatalectic).

(a) This is a line of eight trochaic or quasi-troshaic feet.

(b) The rules governing the Trochaic Septenarius (see D. b,
c, d, f, g), are observed in the Trochaic Octonarius with the
following modifications :

(i) The substitutes mentioned in D. (b) are permitted in
