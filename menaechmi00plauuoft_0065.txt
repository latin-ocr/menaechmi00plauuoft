SYMBOLS

USED IN THE APPARATUS CRITICUS.

FOR symbols denoting MSS. (A, P, codd„ cod„ B, W, ΓΕΒ, C, D)
see Introd. pp. 58-60.

Ital. = Renaissance editors and interpolators.
edd. = majority of previous editions.
n. l. = not clearly decipherable.

Numbers given in brackets thus—(vii. 5)—refer to chapters
and sections of Prof. Lindsay’s Introduction to Latin T extual
E mendation (Macm. 1896).

Where readings of the palimpsest (A) are given in the App.
Crit., the following signs are used: any given number of dots
denotes an equal number of undecipherable letters; a dot placed
beneath a letter means that the identification of that letter is not
certain: a dash indicates an obliteration of the text so complete
that even the approximate number os letters cannot be accurately
discerned. Letters enclosed in brackets have been conjecturally
restored by Prof. Lindsay.

In both the text and the App. Crit. a perpendicular line denotes
a doubtful hiatus ; words or letters within square brackets are
probable interpolations ; angular brackets enclose words or letters
conjecturally supplied by some editor or commentator. Ictus-marks,
where given,·are printed for the sake of clearness only.
