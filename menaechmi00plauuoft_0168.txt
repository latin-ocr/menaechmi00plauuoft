MENAECHMI

ne. . . comesses, ‘you should not have eaten up '; in past
jussive sentences the imperfect subjunctive is always employed
in O. Lat., probably as being the past of the imperatival pres.
subj. ; e. g. ne comedas. Cf. lisere. 63 3—4 requireres, rogitares quis
essel; so Verg. Aen. viii. 643 at lu dictis, Albane, maneres. In

non . . . taceo: the present is normal with non in an answer
to a command or its equivalent3 cf. Stich. 92—3 PAM. adside hic,
pater. AN. non sedeo z'stz'.

nutat ne loquar : addressed to the wife. nutat takes the con-
struction ofa verb of command.

613. nuto . . . nicto: mtto is ageneral term for making signs, but
in a special sense = sign with the head3 m'cto = sign with the
eyes (wink).

614. Kiessling places this line after 619. It certainly seems out
of place here, and 615 would follow 613 more naturally; 620 comes
abruptly after 619, while it would be the natural continuation
01614.

615. nihil hoc confidentius: a colloquiali51r13 cf. 631; Cic.
acl Fam. iV. 4. 2 uictor quo m‘lzz‘l erat moderatius. Confidentius in

617. credit . . . de ‘isti ' : Pen. mockingly repeats the word used
by Men. ; ‘ she believes you now- about “over there ’⁷3 but go back
to the other point.’ This is the reading of Pradel, who takes isti as
an adverb 3 it may, however, be dative in both places, no change to
abl. being needed in the latter place, as it = the word isti. MSS.
read istis, ‘ those words of yours '. Perhaps Men. used isti as
a dative, and Messenio repeats it as an adverb for sake of
contrast with illuc.

illuc: i. e. to the palla. Pen. brings him back to the real
noint. Ι
⁴ 618. quo ego 1 redeam? Men. uses redeam, as Pen. has just
used redi, figuratively 3 Pen. pretends to take his question literally.
