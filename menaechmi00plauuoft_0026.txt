22 INTRODUCTION

based upon the Menaechmi, was performed at Venice in 1508,
and published in ¹524· This was the first Italian comedy to
be performed at the court of France, where it was acted by
requcst of the sister of Henry ΙΙ. Bibbiena made considerable
changes in both plot and dialogue‚ among other alterations
making the twins brother and sister5 and the predilections of
an Italian prelate of that age are manifest in a grossness happily
absent from the original. The Calandra was rapidly followed
by two more Italian adaptations of the Menaechmi, which do
not call for more than passing mention: I Lucidi, by Agnolo
Firenzuola, a courtly dramatist of considerable merit3 and
J Simillimi, by Giovanni Trissino, who is chiefly known for his
rather prosaic tragedy of Sophonisba, and who also wrote an
epic poem of remarkable badness. Both these writers flourished
in the first half of the sixteenth century.

The next direct imitation of the Affenaechmi appeared in
England, where a ffi'slorie of Error was enacted ‘by the
children of Powles’*i. e. boys of St. Paul's Sch0011—‘at
Hampton Court on New Yere’s daie at night, 1576—77’.
Probably the same play (misnamed Hzlvtorie of fibrrar) was
performed at Windsor in 1582. A few years later, in 1594,
a ‘ Comedy of Errors, like to Plautus his Meneehmus‘ was per-
formed at a Grand N ight at Gray’s Inn. This is identified by
most Shakespearian scholars with Shakespeare's play, which is
shown by internal evidence to have been first produced about
1591-2. Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors, in dramatic skill‚
in characterization, and above all in dialogue‚ towers above all
other derivatives of the Menaechmi 3 and a reading of his play
will show that his debt to Plautus is a very modest one, since
