COMMENTARY: LINES 74· 102

91. The hiatus at the caesura is perhaps admissible if we allow

for the original ablative termination in ·d. But see App. Crit.

ad satim used thus adverbially implies the existence osa noni.
satis (satietas) ; it is also used as an indeclinable substantive, adfatim
(ε satis), cs. 4 57 ; ,ll il. 980 tibi diuitiarum adsalimsl. ⁷

92· numquam . . . fugiet: for the sentiment cf. Hor. Sal. i. 5. 67

fragabat Denique em· umquam fugisset, cui salis mm lon-ris libra
oret.
capital = facinus capitale. There should be a lieavy stop
either at fecerit, or (better) at ficgiel.

93. dum = quamdin. Scan di'im eo; see Introd. 7. IV. A. b. i
and cf. 413 nfim Istaec, 449 dam hieto.

94. Scan fta Istae& see Introd. 7. I. C. b, and cf. 265, 335, 528. &a

lenta, ‘ elastic ’; cf. next line.

95. extendas: this use of 2 pers. sing. os subjunctive in general
statements is found elsewhere in Plautus, as well as in later writers ;
cf. Bacch. 63 ubi periclum fizcz'as aculeata sunt. The mood corre-
sponds to Gk. indefinite subj. with ι’ίν. See also notes on 103, 502.

96. nam introduces the particular application of his remarks.

quo: adverb of place substituted for personal relative : so unde!
sor a quo ? 783. As an alternative, eo in this line may be taken as
adverb, and eo in 97 as main verb of 96-7.

97. iudicatus : an insolvent debtor was handed over by the
praetor to his creditor, who kept him in his house in a state of
semi-slavery. In this case Peniculus has adjudged himself to
Menaechmus; he goes willingly and hugs his chains (i.e. uincla
escaria). Cf. A sin. 937 iudicatum me uxor abducit domum.

98. alit . . . educat: N onius distinguishes thus: alere est m'ctu
temporali sustentare, educare autem ad satietatem perpetuam educere.

99. facit, ‘practises'.

100. ita est = huiusmodi est: colloquial use of adverb with esse3
cf. 258, and see note on 485.

ipsus: this form, relatively to ipse, is more frequent in Plautus
than in Terence. Both ipse and ipsus are composed of the demon-
strative is strengthened by the particle -pe (seen in ᾳτιτζῄρε), and the
pronoun-stem so-‚ which appears in the one case as -se (= ·s15), and
in the other as -sus (= -sos)‚ these suffixes corresponding in form to
the Gk. ὁ and ὅς respectively.

escae maxumae : descriptive genitive qualifying ipsus ; ‘ him-
self a hearty eater’ ; cf. Hor. Od. i. 36. 13 multi Damalis meri.

101. cerialis, ‘worthy of Ceres' festival ’. The Cerialia took
place in the Circus and lasted from the 12th to the 19th os Apr11;
the celebrations included heavy banquets.

102. struices . . . patinarias: probably pyramids of various
dishes arranged on stands. Cf. Massinger‚ Citjaeflsadatm ii. 1¹: ‘The
dishes were ranged one upon another As woodmongers do billets!
