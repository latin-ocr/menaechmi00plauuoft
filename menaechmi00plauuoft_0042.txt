38 INTRODUCTION

kind are confined to quadrisyllables with the first three syllables
short, or of the type consilium. The explanation is that in
Plautus’s day such words were still subject to the influence of
an older system of accentuation of which unmistakable traces
are found. According to this earlier law all words were
accented on the first syllable irrespective of length or quantity.
There is therefore no real conflict between ictus and accent in
words like mdlieres, fdcilius as they occur in Plautus's verse²
(cf. Μεη. 321, 978). Words of the consilium type sometimes
retain the older accentuation (as cbnsilium), sometimes follow
the newer system (as consilimn); they were in a transitional
stage.2
Difficulties of the second class—where ictus falls on a final
syllable—are less amenable to explanation. With regard
perhaps to the majority of the very numerous instances of an
iambic word occurring at the end of a line ³ it can only be said
that the ictus falling on the final syllable of a line is of the
secondary or weaker variety, so that the conflict of ictus with
accent is not harsh. Of instances of other kinds, those namely
in which ictus falls on a final syllable elsewhere in a line, many
may be satisfactorily explained by reference to sentence-aecem.
In ordinary speech certain words, as appearing in certain
recurring word-groups, receive a different accent from that
which they would bear if pronounced separately 3 e. g. uoltiptas
a final short syllable following a long one, and are normally accented in
classieal Latin on the final remaining syllable, e. g. words os the types cuids
= cuditis), adddc = addace), postlla'c( = post-hd-ce), credin (= credisne).
Further, some cases have been explained by reference to a supposed law

that when a final syllable was elided the aecent was shisted one foot nearer
the beginning of a word3 but this is doubtful.

Εῗῒ 'Phreloeliange in the system of accentuation seems to have arisen as
follows. Polysyllables naturally acquired a secondary weaker accent, e. g.
tdlercire, tdmpestdtzbus (cf. in Eng. ldgy‘ondries); gradually the principal
and the secondary aceent changed places, and this novel accentuation-
