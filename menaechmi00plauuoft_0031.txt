METRES 27

septenarius (seven-soot)¹; the Greek tetrameter acatalectic
(four-measure complete) the Latin octonarius (eight-foot).

(c) The metres thus borrowed by Plautus and Terence arc
principally iambic and trochaic, In rcckoning thc metrical
value of a foot, each short syllable counts as one mora or
length-unit, each long syllable normally as two: strictly speak-
ing, therefore, the only exact equivalent for the iambus (ψ -) or
the trochee (- υ) is the tribrach (υ o 0)ss But in the verse os
Latin Comedy, as in all natural non-quantitative verse, a
spondee pronounced rapidly may take the value merely of an
iambus or trochee, the unstressed syllable not bearing ictus
seeming to count as a single mora only. For this reason the
spondee (- -) and its metrical equivalents‚ the dactyl (- ψ υ),
anapaest (υ ψ -), and proceleusmatic (o υ υ o), are, under
certain restrictions, admitted by Plautus and Terence as sub-
stitutes sor iambi and trochees in those feet in which they
allow substitution.

(d) In Greek poetry the trimeter had three, the tetrameter
four, strong ictas or main verse-beats, one in each of the odd
feet (and so one only in each dipody) ; there was a weaker
ictus in each of the even feet. The incidence of ictus in Latin
iambic and trochaic verses is generally regarded as following
the Greek rule: though it has also been conjectured that,
as Plautus and Terence disregarded the dipodic arrangement,
such verses, as written by thern, bore a strong ictus in each
foot. If the first of these two opinions is accepted as correct,
the theory that strong ictus seldom conflicts with accent
becomes almost self-evident; but the question is here lest
open,³ except that (as is reasonable) an ictus falling on the last
syllable of a verse is regarded as distinctly weak.

¹ Strictly‚ seven feet and a hals.

² Hence nominally a tribrach alone can be substituted for a trochee in
the last foot of a trochaic octonarius: see below, ΙΙ. E. b. ii.

³ Accordingly in this edition, wherever the scansion os a line is symbolized
(as frequently in this section and the next of the Introduction, and in tlu-
Notes), ictus is marked in each soot for the sake of clearness
