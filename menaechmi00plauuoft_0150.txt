MENAECHMI

352. For the asyndeton cf. Cic. ad an. ii. 5. 2 para, meditare,

cogita.
fiat may depcnd on uide.

353. sternite lectos: i. e. put rugs and cushions on the dining-
couclhes. The plural shows that this is addressed to the inferior
anci lae.

odores: by metonymy for ‘fragrant spices'.
munditia, ‘smartness’, not ‘neatness'; Horace's simplex
munditiis is usually mistranslated.

356. amoenitas, ‘pleasant surroundings ’.

malost = damno est.

359. item hinc ultro, ‘and so by my free gift ’3 hinc = a me3

cf· 799·
potissumus. as long as pallae, &c, are forthcoming; cf. 192.
nostrae domi: so Most. 8743 but 777 nostra domo (Cas. 620).

361. mira uidentur: so often mzra sunl‚cf.1046; usually with
sz or 777, Cas. 191; Psemz'.1216; Trm. 861.

362. quoi pateant: concessixe; cf. 397. On 97707 see Arg. 1.

363. quam domu' tua: sc. est lua3 or (removing comma from
pateant 362 to lua) sc. pales. ·

quom . . . sit, ‘ since my house is more (truly) yours than
your own is ². Plautus usually employs the indicative with causal
(and concessive) quom ; perhaps the subjunctive here implies that
the reason given is not a hard fact; cf. 304 note.

367-8. prandium ut iussisti, &c.: repetition of 364—5, as the
supposed Menaechmus 1 has taken no notice.

369. Men. is speaking to Messenio.

equidem: not = ego quidem, though normally used with the
first person; the e· is perhaps the prefix found in ecastor,
edepol, ἃς. See note on egoquiem, 1071.

370. quia: elliptica13 supply est res milti tecum (quia).

371. neque id haud, ‘ and that too not . . .'. This doubling of
the negative is found in Plautus (in Terence only once, Andr. 205)
with neque (nec) as the first negative; according to Brix‚ this is
because the negative force of 7769776 is weakened by its having to
act as a conjunction. The two negatives are normally separated
by a pronoun3 Bacch. 1037 neque etro hau c07217nz·‚ttam Epid. 664
neque zlle haud obi'czet mi'ln. So nec. .7mmquam 1027.

372. ecastor. see on 213. Scan luz's me (oru Γ s)

florentem facis: for the periphrasis cf. A me 9776777 . . .
§actam seruentem flagra& Pseud. 1041 9777 te unc flentem
acit.

373-4. The weakness of the plot is obvious here. Menaechmus

⁷ would surely have remembered his quest in real life. But he does

not remember even Messenio's warnings (258, 338), or what the
cook said (331).
375. istaec : i. e. what is now happening to you.
