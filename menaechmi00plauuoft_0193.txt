realizes how soolish it is to answer these absurd questions scriously
(cf. percontator); the recollection of his predicaincnt returns, and
he bursts out with a curse at his tormentor.
934. i6nsanire occeptat, ⁴ his fit is really beginning ' ; con·
trast 1 .
d9e inis uerbis, ¹ in consequence of ⁹ ; cs. 266 iam aps le metuo
de uerbis tuis. Niem. takes the phrase with insanire acceptat, in
the sense of ‘judging by those words ⁹.
l935. Nestor: the Homeric King os Pylos, samed sor wisdom and
e oquence.
de uerbis: not as in 934, but ‘in the matter οἷ’, ‘ with regard
to’ ς cf. alost. 569 quidde aaegentost?; Pseud. 123 ; Caecil. (161 Rib-

prae-ut . . . fuit: lit. ‘in coinparison with how he was’, &c., -

937. dixti insanus, ‘you said it in a mad fit’; dixti is Leo’s
correction of MSS. dixi, which Scholl retains, arranging thus:
ΜΕΝ. quid ego dixi? SE. insanus, inquam—, the speech of the

Scholl’s arrangement, but reads insanu's, which, however, is incon-
sistent with 935.

thus ε ΜΕ. quis se dicit llaec mesacere uidisse aut quis arguit ,θ

sub furca: the furca was a heavy wooden yoke, shaped like
a V or Π, which was fastened on the neck os a delinquent slave,
his hands being bound to the arms of the implement, which pro-
jected in front over his shoulders. Sometimes the victiin merely
had to walk through the city bearing the yoke, and proclanning his
fault as he went; sometimes his progress was rendered more
painsul by the application of rod or lash; cf. Livy ii. 36. 1 seruom
