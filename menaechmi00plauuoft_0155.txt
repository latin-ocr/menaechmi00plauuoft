COMMENTARY: 1.1NF,S 420 “45

whi‘ih gives ut me dices ; Brix adopts the latter in the sense qualem
me tces.

A further difficulty is the division os the speeches. tf the
arrangement of the present text is accepted, the connexion is
as follows (reading sussili 432—3) : MESS. ‘ What's the matter? Up
and away! ' MEN. ⁸ why should 1 ?’ MESS. ‘ You must ' (he
is going to say ‘ avoid danger ’). ΜΕΝ. (interrupting) ‘1 know
(what you are going to say), so that you need not say it.' MESS.
⁸ (You are) so much the worse (if you are acting thus with your eyes
open) ’. Brix⁵ divides thus: (432-3) MEss. quid negoti est ‚2 ΜΕΝ.
sussult’. (434) MESS. quid ec> opust .? MEN.¹ opust. scio ut me
dices: i.e. ‘ You must Ξ Ι know what you're going to call me ' (ut
=‘ how '). Cf. Stich. 95 AN. quid opust ? PAN. opust.

tanto nequior: sc. es; for the omission cf. ts'ticlz. 749 tanto
miceriam Truc. 953 tanto melior, and see note on 338.

435. habeo . . . operis: military metaphor; ‘I have the spoil
in my grasp, such fine siege works have 1 begun ’. Taken literally‚
this line is inconsistent with est . . . nobis, 441: perhaps praedam
here should be altered to praedem. For the hiatus cs. 431.

quantum potes = quam celerrime ; cf. 5493 Aul. 119 quantum
poter03 so quantum potest impersonaHy, 850, 1056 ; A ul. 399, ἃς.
Cf. Cic. adAtt. iv. 13, ix. 7.

436. istos: the nauales pedes, 350. ,

437. ante solem occasum: cf. 10223 XII Tab. (Geli. xvii. 2. 10)
sol occasus suprema tempestas esto ; in this phrase the participle has
neuter force, as in iuratus, pransus, potus.

uenias aduorsum: a phrase applied to a slave fetching (or
carrying) his master home from a dinner-party ; cf. 445, 464, 987 ;
Most. 938, 947. Donatus says that such a slave was called aduor-
sitor‚ and in the dram. pers. of the Μοςιῐ, Phaniscus Aduersitor
appears; but the word does not occur elsewhere.

438. Ritschl suggests atque hinc abi to fill the l.acuna; Vahlen
etsac tuom (⁶ mind your own business'), which suits the next line
better. Palmer thinks that uerbere may have dropped out through
homoeoteleuton with fecero 439.

440. warner paraphrases : ‘ Peace foolish knave, seest thou not
what a sot she is3 I shall coozen her 1 warrant thee.J

442. lembum, ‘ cockboat ’‚ not a match for a nanu-3 cs. 344.

dierectum with ducit: ‘is towing it to the. deuce ’ 3 dzerectus
(lit. ‘spread-eagled ’‚ i. e. ‘ crucified ’) is so used in curses, Poen. 347
z· dz’erecte in maxumam malam crucem. Perhaps, as Nettleship
suggests, dierectus is ‘some bastard issue of διαρρὴγνυμι ’; διηρραγειης
(⁴ split you ’) is a curse common in Gk. comedy.

443. postulem, ‘ expect ’, takes acc. and infin. on the analogy of
uolo. (Gk. ἀξιῶ.) Cf. 767.

445. sequimini: to the sailor-porters. Exeunt Mess. and por-
ters, leaving stage clear; second pause in the play.
