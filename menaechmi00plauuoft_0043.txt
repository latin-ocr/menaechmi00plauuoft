or misero in many collocations bear the ordinary accent, but in
word—groups such as uoluptcis-mea‚ uae'mtkerffimilu' the accent is
dragged forward by the unimportant words or ‘sentence-
enclitics ’ following the words in question. To put it differently,
word-groups of this kind are treated as single words and
accented accordingly. Lindsay makes a full classification
of sentence-enclitics which may thus affeet accentuation ;
a brief outline may here be given, with the addition of a few
examples taken at random from this play :

(a) all parts of the verb esse, auxiliary or copulative ; e. g.
654 defitssz' sumus 3 similarly es and est frequently coalesce with
a preceding word, as 41 szcrrziptust, 293 mole‘stu‘s, &a (Prob-
ably in these cases es and the two first letters of est disappear
altogether: i. e. we should write surruptus’t‚ molestus.)

(b) possessive pronouns when unemphatie3 e. g. 300 crcim
meam, 597 oculis inspexi mess, 750 patre'm meum (see Introd. 6.
11. A. f. iii).

(c) personal pronouns when unemphatic3 e. g. 396 ire
infitia's milzi; cf. 640 me' rogas? (emphatic) pol hau' roge'm te
(unemphatic).

(d) a verb which is used with a noun to express an action
that might be expressed by a verb alone, as frequently
do and fado, e. g. 61 dotata'm dedit, 99 medicindm facit,
176 foressrferio, 343 amittant domum, 630 tetuli pedem.

(e) nouns of subordinate meaning, such as res, modus, &c.,
e. g. 84 aliqud modo, 317 illo'c mod03 here we may place such
groups as malam crucem, 66, 328 3 and expressions of time such
as intereci loci 446, trzjgintci dies 951 (cf. 91 cottidie).

(f) similarly prepositions coalesce with a governed word
following3 e. g. 91 dd satim, 684 a'a' sorum3 so frequently
cib se, &c.

It may, then, be enunciated as a formal law that Plautine
prosody depends mainly upon the word· and sentence-accentua-
tion of ordinary speech 3 but that Plautus so constructs his
