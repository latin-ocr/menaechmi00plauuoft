master) as fundantarces — atkilli— T yrt‘okardebat ——- demissex
umeris. He would certainly have slurred the terminations in
question, but the slurred syllables would still have been
recognizable. The point in which the cornic dramatists
differed fron] the Augustan poets was that the former fre-
quently did, while the latter as a rule did not, reckon such
slurred syllables as part of a metrical foot. The Augustan
poets¹ consciously adopted, as far as metre was concerned,
the Greek treatment of elided syllables. The reason why the
Greeks did not count such syllables in the scansion was that
in ordinary speech their elision was not a slurring merely?
but the actual dropping of a vowel-sound‚ such as may be
heard in the northern counties of England, where ‘down the
street ', ‘in the beck ’, ‘over the sell' are actually pronounced
‘doont' strate ⁷, ‘int’ beck ³, ‘owert’ fell ’. In adopting strict
rules of elision the Augustan poets were borrowing tastelessly
from Greece a second metrical usage—the first being quanti-
tative prosody—which, while perfectly adapted to the Greek
tongue, was totally foreign to the genius and natural pronuncia-
tion of the Latin language.

On the other hand Plautus, who in this respect as in others
was far more trulya representative of genuine Roman literature,
followed the natural practice of reckoning or disregarding
a slurred syllable in scansion according to the requirements
of metre. Such a practice should present no difficulty to the
student of English literature, who will frequently find a syllable,
word, or phrase reckoned in the scansion in this passage, and
disregarded metrically in that, and who will not feel it necessary
to give it a grotesque pronunciation in the latter case. Shake-
