COMMENTARY: LINES 71 8-5 2

ita rem esse: almost ‘that it is necessary '; lit. ‘ that there is
profit in so doing ’ς cf. 661 ex re tua . . . seceris (Capt. 296 lua re
sec.), and the phrase in rem alicuius, ‘to one’s profit ’. On the
double hiatus see App. Crit.‚ and note on 720. Cf. lntrod. 7.
1v. C. b and D. c. i, d, pp. 54—6.

739. pallam: probably the hiatus should here be avoided by
reading with Vahlen pallas, plural of exaggeration or of gencraliza-
tion, as 796 uiros, 803 pallas-3 in the latter line 132¹ has pallam.

740. On the second hiatus see App. Crit.. and note on 720. Cf.
Introd. 7. 1V. B. b and IV. D. d, pp. 53, 56.

741. fabulor ε in allusion to fabulas 7²4·

742. quod bibam ε i.e. an antidote or a prophylactic.

743. qui- posgim, ⁴ to enable me '.

arbitrere: MSS. have arbitrare, corrected by Luchs on the
ground that elsewhere Plautus invariably uses subjunctive in a
cla6use8dependent on nescio. See Sonnenschein's Rudens, notes on
3574}.5si111il:u . .. cum, ‘just as well as ’, ironical; cf. 748 noui
cum Calcha simul. Possibly the meaning is : ‘ I made your acquaint-
ance on the same day as Porthaon's ' ; cf. 749. sifnilu is said to be

Porthaone: Porthaon was the grandfather of Hercules' wife
Deianeira. The name is chosen here as that of an obscure mytho-
logical character.

746. at pol, ‘ surely at least ¹ ; see note on 670.

748. filum here and in 746, 749, is emphatic, as the scansion
· shows ; · do you know him ?’ (ironically).

cum Calcha simu1; see note on 745. In view of 749, probably
noui is here at any rate to be taken as aorist ; cf. 299, 501.
Calcha, heteroclitic form, for usual Calchante; cf. Chremem, -is,
side by side with Chremetem, -is‚ in Terence. The name of
Calchas (the aged seer of the Greeks before Troy) is chosen here
as that of a doting greybeard.

749. &dem die: cf. 5 39-40 simul.

750. The parallelism of the two halves shows that the meaning
is ‘ Do you deny knowing my father just as you deny knowing
me ? ’‚ and partly accounts for the double iambic ending, on which
see further Introd. 6. 11. A. f. iii, p. 29.

7 51. dicam: fut. indic. corresponding to si uis adducere (= si
adduces) in the protasis; cf. our use of auxiliary ‘will' to form
futures.

752· pariter . . . soles: elliptical‚ = pariter hoc (sacis) atque
Ϊιςὶιάὗ res (facere) soles3 cf. 766 ita istaec solent; Bacch. 2033
