COMMEN'I‘ARY: rmus 294-321

1031-3. Perhaps the indicative lays stress on the fact a.» saut .

(cf. 904), the subjunctive on the fact as reason (cf. 374, 443).

310. audin draws attention, like our ‘ l say! ' (vulgar ⁴ 1)'y'ear? ἰ.

311. nummum illum: either a case of attraction to the relative,
or, more probably, an anacoluthon natural in conversatioxn ‘that
half-crown you promised 111e--you’cl better buy a pig with it your-
self '. Cf. 64-5, 1052.

314-15. porculum: see on parce· 289.

316. eu hercle: cs. 731, 872, 160 cu edepol nc, and on these
combinations see note on 160. In the absence of a finite verb they
are normally followed by an accusative. Scan cz? leffrlcsff Ιιὸυιῐηζευι ;
hiatus after an interjection‚ with shortening os vowel or diphthong‚
is regular, see Introd. 7. IV. D. a. i ; hiatus before cases of homo
occurs often in MSS. of Plautus, and, when perinissible on other
grounds, may be allowed ‘to stand, though Brix wished to change
hominem, &c., to the archaic forms lmmfincm, &o (see Lindsay's
Lat. Lang. p. 367), in all such passages; cs. Introd. 7. IV. F, p. 57.

multum, ‘tedious', ‘ wearisome'; there is too much of him.
The word is so used in classical prose3 cf. Cic. de Orat. ii. 87 nc in
re nota et peruolgata multus . . . sim. Livy and Tacitus use nimius
in the same way.

317-18 are an ‘aside ' addressed to the audience. Line 317 has
more point is 316 is given to Men„ as by Brix and other edd. 316,
if given to Mess„ is an aside‚ and 317 is an abrupt and awkward
continuation of 310-15.

318. quam uis: used here, as always by Plautus, in its litera}
sense of ⁴ (as much) as you wish' (Classical qmmtumm‘s).

ridiculus: in active sense.

319. quid ais tu? to call Men.’s attention3 cf. 162.

quid ais, inquam. Impatient repetition. Menaechmus and
Messenio are whispering together and pay no attention. This is
Goldbacher's emendation of MSS. qui uis; most edd. read quid
uis, and distribute the line thus: quid ais su ‚³ ΜΕΝ. quid uls,
inquam (cf. 310). CV. satin hoc, &c.

hoc quod uides: he shows him the contents of the sportula.

320. an opsono: the ‘deliberative' pres. indic. is colloquial,
and therefore common in comedy; cs. Most. 774 eon, uoco leuc
hominem? So elsewhere, Juv. iv. 130 concz'dz'lur ? Cic. ad A ll. xiii.
40 aduolone an maneo ‚P So we say ‘ What do we do next ? ⁹

321. tibi . . . mulieri: in apposition to uobis; out of place here;
such careless order is colloquial.

321—2. quas [tu] mulieres . . . loquere? An expression of in-
dignant repudiation ; cf. Pseud. 1195 quem ln Pseudolum, quas lu
milti praedicas fallacias& Curc. 546; Cic. ad Fam. ix. 16. 7 quem
tu milti pompilum‚ quem denarium narras, quam tyrotarsshz'
patinam ? Unless the first tu is omitted, the lines must be scanned
