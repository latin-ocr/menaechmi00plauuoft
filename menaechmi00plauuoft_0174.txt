MENAECHMI

688. nec te: Erotium interrupts him, mockingly echoing his

neque edepol le.
ultro with 07¹auz'; she was not the one to mention it first.

689. Scan de'dz'sh c1am3 but see App Crit. Sho-rtening isjustified
by elision of final syllable. see Introd. 7. Ι. Α. a. i, p 42.

690. patiar: in a sarcastic tone of resignation. She will put up
with it, as she rnust; but she will not sorget it.

tibi habe, aufer: the hiatus, if allowed should probably come
after ti’3bz see note on 389. Guyet proposes habe tz'bz. We may
also scan libz Ιιιῖὐε, Ι alifer (hiatus at pause).

691. in loculos· sarcastic exaggeration; cf. Hor. Epp. ii. 1. 175
gestat enim nummum in loculos deszttere

692. ne frustra sis: this common phrase may be taken either
as a prohibition (‘ don't make any mistake’, ‘be assured of that ⁹),
or as final, i. e. ι(Ι tell you) in order that you may not deceive
yourself'. Cf. Capt. 854, διο.

693. habes despicatui: the latter word occurs only here and
Cic. pro Flacco 27. 65 sz ques despi'caluz ducztur. Plautus makes
very free use of the predicative dative, especially of verbal nouns
of the fourth declension; cf. 695 frustratur ‚ Poen. 1281 lud ficatuz ,
C ist. 365 remque noslram habes perditui et praedatus.

694. frustra, ‘ for nothing ⁹, ‘ fruitlessly ⁹ (from her point of view).
She implies, however, that she will not sacrifice business to
revenge.

ductare = domum ducere (meretricem) ; cf. Poen. 868 ductas
gratias-3 Asin. 164—5, 169. It is wrong therefore to take frustra
ductare as =frustra habere (‘ cheat ’). Ritschl suggests frustra’s,
me ductare non potes.

695. frustratui ; ἅπαξ λεγόμενον; cf. 693 note.

696. nimis iracunde: sc. est: ‘'Gad, she’s tremendously angry
at last ⁹. For this use of the adverb cf. Merc. 583 pulcre ut simus,
and see 48 5, note. Seyffert reads hercle z‘raczinde to give the latter
word its usual accent: but possibly when the last syllable was
elided the accent was thrown back (irdcund’).

heus tu: cf. 673. Erotium is just disappearing into the
house.

697. etiamne astas ’ἓ etiam (we) is joined with second person
pres. indic. in impatient commands or despairing requests; cf. Trin.
514 etiam tn taces? Here ‘won't you stop ? '

etiam audes, ‘ won't you be good enough . . . ?' For dropping
of second -ne cf. Pers. 474 sumne probus, sum lepidusYWk ,ἲ and for
this use of audes cf. sodes ( = si audes), ‘please '.

698. exclusissumus‚ ‘ utterly out in the cold ’3 comic formation ;
cf. Aul. 633 uerberabz'llssume. Warner renders vividly: ‘ Now
I arn everie way shut out for a very bench-whistler.’

700. hanc rem amicos: for double accusative cf. Cic. Att. vii.
20. 2 nec te id consulo. Here there is also an object-clause, quid . . .
