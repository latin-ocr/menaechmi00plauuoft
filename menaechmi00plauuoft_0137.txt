COMMENTARY: LIN Es 168-84

in of the final syllable os ma'm· see Introd. 7. 1. A. a. ii, and cs. 225
refigit, 416 κάεέ, 517 iffibi:
eccam: sor the formation of this word see 109 note. liscum,
-am, eccillum, -am‚ can, as here, be placed parentlietically in
' a sentence without affecting the construction; cf. 219, 567, 772,
Bacch. 611 Mnesilochus eccum umeslus pae-‹grredimr saras. When
a noun without a verb follows one os these words, it is normally put
into the accusative3 cf. 565, 898: Mil. (ilar. 1216 ecszaem praesse
militem.

179-81. solem uides satin ut occaecatust: uides is Leo’s correc-
tion ofMSS. uideo. For the late position of the interrogative particle
cf. Cure. 18 et lteri cenauistl'ne ,P Solem, logically the subject of the
dependent clause, becomes grammatically the object of the main (cf.
Greek οἶδά σε ὅστις εἴ) ; this ‘ anticipatory ’ construction is common
in Plautus, cf. 246, 1083. Thus the sentence = uiden ut (‘how’)
sol satis occaecatust . . . ? For the indic. in a dependent interroga-
tive clause cf. 207. Acidalius’s suggestion solem uide—satin ut
occaecatust . . . ,Ρ can be paralleled by Sta-le. 2704 lwc uide, Satin
ut facete, atque ex pictura astitit? where satin ul (= salin est ut)
has the force of a very surprised nonne; cf. Mil. 1134 saline ut
Commoditas usquequaque me aclimcat! So satin alone frequently
stands for nonne or -ne ; 522, Mil. 481 salin abiit ille ‚2

181. huius in the text should be written leuiius to indicate
scansion : see page 47, note 2.

182. extra numerum es, ‘you don’t count'; lit. ‘you’re not
reckoned in' ; she means that he is not worth noticing‚ or that he
is de tr0p3 but he contrives to turn it into a compliment 183. In
military language extra numerum = not assigned to any definite
position ; cf. Verg. Aen. vi. 545 explebo numerum.

183. adscriptiuis . . . ad legionem : explains aliis. These were

Ι unarmed reserves, who took the place and arms of armed legionaries

that fell in a battle. They were, of course, picked troops. Pen.
answers Erotium’s sneer by saying: ‘ That’s also the case of the
picked reserves attached to a legion! There is a hint‚ too, that he
is ready to take Men.'s place with Erotium if Men. is rendered
hors de combat (by the bottle). Niemeyer (Brix5), completely
misunderstanding the force of Pen.’s remark, and imagining that
he is protesting against being considered an adscrzfitiuus, gives
183—8 to Pen.‚ and alters 188 (embodying a correction of Scholl)
to tuae legioni adiudicato, ut cum uiro (Scholh co) lzcmc noctem
sies. Scan {dem istuc-3 cf. 184 &go z'slz'c, 375 &go ἴείαὲε, 622 νηιἼιί
{stag 651, 782, &c.
184- 5. istic = apud te: for redundancy cs. cas. 546 isli apud uos.
iussi: there is no need to adopt Acidalius’s correction iussim :
we may suppose that the question had been mooted before. There
is no inconsistency with 174; the proelium is a drinking-match,
different from the prandium, which is not mentioned till 208. At
