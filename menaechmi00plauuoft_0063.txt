a consensus of the extant minuscule MSS„ are designatcd by
the symbol P. It is further conjectured that before the loss
of the original P, two copies of it at least were made, from one
of which extant minuscule MSS. derived eight plays, the re-
maining twelve being derived from the other. These supposed
copies are referred to respectively by the symbols ΡΜ) (source
for the ‘first eight’ plays, i.e. Amph„ Asin„ Aul„ Capt„ Cura,
Cas., Cist„ Epiri), and PBC (source for the remaining or ‘last
twelve ' plays).

Of extant MSS. of the P group containing the r‘llenaecllmt',
the chief are :

(a) Codex Vetus (B), a MS. of the tenth or early eleventh
century, now in the Vatican Library at Rome. It contains all
the plays, but there are clear indications¹ that the last twelve
plays are not derived from the same copy of P as the first eight.
Hence has been inferred the existence of PBD and PBG, referred
to above. This MS. was discovered in the sixteenth century
by the German scholar Camerarius, and is the main source of
our existing texts. where, however, its authority clashes with
that of A, preference is as a rule to be given to the readings
of the latter on the score of its superior antiquity. Valuable
corrections by several hands appear in B, the most important
being those denoted by the symbol ΒΞ.

(b) Codex Ursinianus (D), now in the Vatican, a MS. of
rather later date than the last. It resembles B fairly closely,
that part of it which contains the last twelve plays being, it is
conjectured, derived from a missing original (PCD) which, like
the corresponding part of B, was a copy of PBC.

(c) Codex Decurtatus (C), a MS. of the eleventh or early
twelfth century, now at Heidelberg. Its readings closely
resemble those of D, C and D having probably been derived

¹ That part of B which contains the last twelve plays was evidently
copied from an original superior to that from which B derived the first
eight; according to Lindsay, it may even have been copied (lirectly from
the archetype.
