446. Peniculus has lost Menaechmus I in a crowd, and returns to

451. qui illum . . . perduint: qui (⁶ how') is frequently used
thus with the force of utinam (Gk. ὡς) ; cf. 931-3 ; so also

453. ’ἷο avoid the hiatus Onions proposes non ad eam rem ni
otiosos (not interrogative), Vahlen, non saltem, with the sense : ‘if
assemblies must be held, at any rate men with nothing to do might
be employed to attend them ³. (For the restrictive use of saltem cf.
6243 Amph. 4383 lisera-‚637—8.) See, however, Introd. 7.1V. A. b. ii.
Perhaps there is a pause at rem to emphasize otiososssntrod. 7.
IV. D. d, . 56).

4 54. (μιὲῐη citentur: his suggestion is that whenever a contio is
held, the names of ciues otiosi should be read out like those ofable-
bodied citizens at a dz‘leclus, and that those who failed to turn up
should be punished.

census capiat ilico ε this is the reading of A and of 13², and
may be interpreted (1) taking census as nom. sing„ ‘punishment
(the censor's rebuke) should overtake them ⁹: there is no parallel
for census in this sense, but censio is so used, e. g. A ul. 601 censione
bubula 3 still more to the point is Rud. 1269 seq., where one speaker
replies censeo to all questions, until the other says adsum equidem,
ne censionem semper facias, which may be taken either ‘so don‘t
punish me for non-attendance ⁷, or ‘ don’t keep saying censeo ’. Per-
haps census = fine 3 see below. (2) Taking census as acc.plur., the
subject being magistratus understood (so P, census capiant, se.
magistrams) ; ·‘ he should assess them (preparatory to a fine) ’ 3 or
simply ‘ he should amerce thern in a fine ³, though the latter mean-
ing of census cannot be paralleled. Still less can it mean ngnora (as
Pareus says). Leo solves the difficulty by reading ngnzcs capiat.
Senators failing to attend meetings of the Senate were liable to
seizure of goods l'ngnorz'scapio), which they could r‘ffdeem by pay-
ing a fine. Perhaps censu capiat, ⁴ deprive thern of civil rights ⁹, may
be suggested on the analogy of censu prohibere (excludere) and
allero captus oculo.
