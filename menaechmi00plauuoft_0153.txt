COMMENTARY: 1.1N1·:s 387-420

generally a dactyl ; but cf. Herc. 365. 'l'lie connexion οἱ thought
is: ⁸ (l cannot accept your invitation) as you take ine for some-om·
else-³ There is no need to assume :i lacuna with Ritsclil. Fleckeisen
reads nese-quuem (lu).

409-10. ubi, ‘ where ' (referring to syracusisi.

409-12. Agathocles and Hiero were historica} characters well
known to the Romans. The former was tyram of Syracusa¹ 317
289 B. C. ; the latter was elected strategus in 269, :ind made himself
tyrant by force (not peacefully as Erotium says) in 265. Phintia and
[Ᾰρανο are inventions here, the former being the name of a tyram
of Agrigentum about 280 B. C„ the latter probably being suggested
by the Liparae lslands off Sicily. Plautus (or his Greek original) is
true to life in representing a woman of Erotiuin's class as guilty of
such blunderS. An Aspasia was rare. With regard to the bearing
of this passage on the date of the play see Introd. 3.

412. Hiero est: sc. regnator.

see on 247-8. Cf. also Verg. Aen. iv. 547 quin morere . . . ferroque
auerte dolorem.

418. si possum: Plautus uses sz' with a verb (usually possum)
in the subj. to express ‘to see if‘, ‘in the hope of'‚ exactly as
classical writers d0‚ with one exception ; when (as here) the depen-
dent verb is in the first person, and present time is referred to, the
indicative is used. Cf. Mil. 1207 nam si possem ullo modo impr·-
trare . . . operam dedi (past time); Verg. Aen. vi. 78 bacchatur
uates, magnum si pectore possit Excussisse deum (third perseum
Hor. Epp. i. 7. 39 inspice, si possum donata reponere laetus (a
reminiscence of Plautine usage) ; 1048-9 below, ibo . . . si possum
exorare.

iam dudum. So far Men. has been speaking aside to Messenio ;
he now speaks aside to Erotium, pretending that he does not want
