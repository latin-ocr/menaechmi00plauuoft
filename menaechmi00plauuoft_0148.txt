MENAECHMI

silias, &c.‚ where the double change of ictus and therefore of accent
is impossible, though apparently supported by 281—2pdra52712m . . .
fiarasffum (where, however, change in place of poss. adj. alone
justifies it). For omission of first tu cf. Cure. 613 quod argentum,
quas tu milei tricas narras .?

322. quod . . . scelus: i.e. what crime sor which you are paying
the penalty of madnesS, as manifested by your behaviour? See

323. quid . . . rei? ‘ what have you to do with me ?’ rei partitive,
cf. 369—70 3 so in good prose, quid ltocrez' est ,9 ‘ what’s the matter ?‘
For lsz‘ cf. 302.

325. For hiatus after lu bearing ictus cf. 651, 744.

326. madebunt faxo, ⁴ l’ll warrant they’ll be cooked ’ς colloquial
paratactic construction, cf. 950p0tab1'sfirx03 also with subj. 113

axo . . . uisas; cf. 539, 644. On the formfaxo see 113 note.
nil morabitur: sc. cenam, or perhaps mm morari is always
transitive in Plautus.

p longiyus (‘ too far’), is correct, retains the original long vowel of
the comparative stem (l072g2'(35-); but see App. Crit. Cf. also 846,

328. numquid uis ? polite formula ofleave-taking3 cf. 548. The
proper reply is ualens. Men. takes it literally3 cf. 138, and Ter.
A d. 432 SY. numquid uis .? DE. mentem uobis meliorem dari.

maxumam . . . crucem: the simple accus„ as well as accus.
with in, is found in this phrase in O. Lat. (e. g. Pers. 352, Pom.
496). In the early stage of a language relations are sufficiently
defined by case-endings; gradually the force of the case-suffix is
weakened‚ and as the growing complexity of life necessitates
greater exactness of expression, relations begin to be more clearly
defined by the employment of adverbs which, occurring constantly
with particular cases, become what we call prepositions ‘governing ’
those cases. In the final stage prepositions almost entirely replace
case—endings, as in modern French. Relics of the older usage in
Latin appear in common phrases like domum ire, rure redire, &c.;
cf. 396 ire infitias, 1020 suppetias . . . aduem'. See Lindsay, Lat.
Lang„ p. 572. On this permissible double iambicenQng see Introd.
6. ΙΙ. A. s. iii, and cf.66‚915, 1017.

329. ire . . . te: the line begins as though he were about to
return the curse, but finishes with a thoughtful⁸ suggestion.
