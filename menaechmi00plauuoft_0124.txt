MENAECHMI

6. Brix ⁶, who claims the prologue as genuine, explains the con-
tradiction between this line and 15 by saying that this promise
is made to secure the attention of the audience3 when silence pre·
vails, the speaker changes his tone and promises them good measure
running over (14-ιὸ). This seems rather far-fetched.

7. See introduction to Prologue above. No satisfactory meaning
can be assigned to atque here. A further indication tbat the Pro-
logue is a piece os patchwork is the change in the speaker’s attitude.
From here onwards he seems to represent the author (cf. 10, 23,
&c.)‚ whereas in 1-6 he represents the acting manager (cf. 3).

8. autumant )( sactum dicitur 10. To whom does this refer?
Perhaps 7—12 are taken from some Greek comic prologue without
regard to 'their pointlessness on a Roman stage.

9. qud illlud: see Introd. 7. IV. A. a. ii, p. 51.

illud = argumentum, or perhaps the play generally.

10. nusquam dicam: sc. aliquid factum esse3 ubi = ibi ubi.
‘1 shall not say that a thing happened anywhere but where 1 am
informed it did happen.’

factum dicitur: i. e. by his imaginary informant 3 cf. 22 and
46. Similar devices are common in our modern novels.

11. atque adeo: corrective 3 see 21 note.

graecissat, ‘ has a Greek setting '. In a fragment of Poseid-
ippos ἀττικίζειν and ἑλληνίζειν are opposed. Z, which, like y, is not
found in inscriptions before the end of the seventh century A.U.c., is
usually represented in O.L. by ss; cf. cyathissare (303), badisso,
tarpessz'ta ( = τραπεζίτης), διε.

12. sicilicissitat: comic prolongation into frequentative form.
See Introd. .

13. antelggium : a hybrid word = ‘ prelude, preface’. The
hiatus before hoc is not ad1nissible; see App. Crit. If Lindsay’s
suggestion is adopted, lzoc fini is to be taken in the sense ‘thus
far ' ; cf. osse fini 859.

14, 15. ‘ I will give you (your allowance of) plot, measured not by
the bushel,’ &c. The speaker assumes the rffle of a steward giving
slaves their rations. Slaves on a sarm received four modii of corn
a mouth, free labourers, whose work was easier‚ three modz'i(cf.
trimodia, 15). Perhaps there is a punning allusion to the phrase
argentum meliri, to pay money by weight (wholesale).

demensum: depon. participle with pass· force: the neut. is
used as a substantive = ‘ allowance '. Cf. Stich. 60.

15. ipso horreo: cf. the phrase de dolio haurire. >sae also on 6
above.

16. S)can <idest ; see Introd. 7. 1. A. a. i, and cf. 17 fz‘ii‘t Ι S yracusis
(or sec-tt .

19, 20. mater . . . quae mammam dabat: i. e. nutrix )( mater
quae pepererat. Sometimes mater alone is used in this sense,
as Cz'st. 192: Verg. Aen. viii. 632 (of the wolf suckling the twins).
