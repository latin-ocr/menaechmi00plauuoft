MENAECHMI

Edd. who adopt the latter view quote Capt. 744; Verg. Aen. xi. 97-8.
Havet‚ who takes these words in the way preferred above, states
th at as a general rule s duem is used by characters m Plautus only
in reply to a gieeting; the opening greeting is always salue. He
gives as illustrations Asin. 296-7; Cure. 234—5 ; [llere. 283—4 (reading
of A); leud. 416. He adds that it is used here either as a more
ceremonious formula, or that it has sull future imperative force,
and = ‘to you (Men. ΙΙ) 1 shall presently say salue’; i.e. when
he formally greets his old master as patronus on receiving his
freed01n3 cf. 1031 ; alost. 746. The former and simpler of these
explanations is to be preferred. leuci. 103 is against Havet's view.
1077. hunc: pointing to Men. ΙΙ.

quae haee fabulast ’.7 ‘What’s all this business ?’ A slang use
of sabula (cf. Germ. GesckicMe), as in [Most. 937 3 Pers. 788 3 Ter.
And. 747: pl. fabulae = foolish tales, nonsense3 cf. 724 above.

1078. Why did not Men. II express incredulity in 1068—9?
Probably because he thought that Men. Ι was either joking or
attempting a confidence trick (cf. 1087). Again, why does not
Men. 11 at once perceive that Men. I is the brother whom he
is seeking? The answer is that dramatic requirements make it
necessary that the ἀναγνώρισις should be slow and gradual ; that it
is so slow‚ however, is one of the improbabilities of the plot.

Moscho: cf. 407.

1081. Messenio’s words down to seuocabo erum are spoken

aside.

spem . . . quam suspico, ‘that consummation os which I have
a presentiment ' (explained in next line) ε sor spes = ‘fulfilrnent of
hope’ cf. λίβη. 843 spem speratam quom opltclz‘sli3 and for this
use of sui-piceo) cf. [eud. 1091, Ter. Heaut. 614.

suspice: but cf. Rud. 1091 suspicor. So in Plautus we find
opino, ludific0‚ mereo, vaga, as well as the deponent forms.

1083. patrem et patriam: ‘anticipatory‘ construction. Singular,
because the Menaechmi mentioned only one father and one country
between thern.

commemorant pariter, ‘ mention in identical terms ’.
quae: either neuter, as referring to nouns of different gender,
or feminine, agreeing in gender with the last 1101111

1084. quid uis? naturally both answer in a duet to the call
lsenaeckme.

1085. uter: relativ·e ‚ cf. 1873 ‘but (Ι 11 ant the one) of you two
that . . .' Cf. Com. osErr. v. 1. 369: Adr. ‘Whicbogyou two did
dine with me to· day θ’

nostrorum: a colloquial form of the partitive gen. cf.
Aul. 321; Stzclz. 141.

1087. Scan Ιτουιό ιιιῖί; but see App. Crit. Legitimate hiatus:
Introd. 7. IV. Β. a. i, pp. 52-3.
