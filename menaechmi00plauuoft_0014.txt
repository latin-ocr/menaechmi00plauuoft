A very large number of plays was originally ascribed to him‚¹
but it is probable that the majority of these were in no sense
Plautino, while many of the rest were merely adaptations os
existing plays, both Latin and rough translations from Greek, .
carried out by Plautus as an experienced actor-manager. The
case of Shakespeare again presents a parallel. At the same time
several plays were early recognized as owing their Latin dress
to Plautus alone, and Varro fixed the canon by enumerating
twenty-one as indisputably of Plautine authorship (i. e. as
adapted by Plautus from the Greek at first hand). These include
the twenty still extant, together with the Vidnlaria, of which
fragments remain in the Ambrosiam palimpsest. “

The plays of Plautus and Terence were fabulae palliatae, i. e.
plays adapted from Greek originals, in which both the setting
and the dresses were Greek (pallium = ἱμάϊιον).2 The Greek
dramatists whose plots they borrowed were those representing
the ‘ N ew' Comedy, which portrayed the contemporary social
life of Athens, and which consisted mainly of variations on the
same theme, with the same set of characters-fathers and sons,
wives, parasstes, slaveS, courtesans, and panders. The pro-
hibition of politics and personalities on the Romaqstage made
it impossible to adapt plays of the ‘Old' or Aristophanic
