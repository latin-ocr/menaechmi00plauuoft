without expecting Celia to abbreviate the last worcl; on the
other hand he gives the word its full nietrical value in other
lines such as Polonius’s

‘Good sir ’, Ι or sb, Ι or ‘friendg ᾖ or ‘genfftlemanK

To summarize briefly, Plautus, though freely using elision,
frequently allows syllables capable of elision¹ either part of
their metrical value (especially in certain frequently reeurring
phrases), or full metrical value (before pauses in inetre, sense,
or delivery). It may be added that instances of both these
natural methods occur, though comparatively rarely, in the
works os the Augustan poetS.

Instances of Hiatus in this play may be classified as follows :

A. Hiatus is frequently allowed, in certain constantly recurring
phrases, after certain monosyllables capable of elision ;

(a.) ending in a long vowel or diphthong (chiefly tu, si, and
parts of qui), the vowel or diphthong retaining half its value
only, i. e. being shortened: as,

(i) when the unelided syllable bears ictus: 115 (a cretic)
qu& Zgo aim, cf. 6183 789 qm‘i‘ ἔᾶίΙ; 374 qua} lcmeJnem, cf.
473-43 786 qui* &go ἴςΙίιίῑ, cf. 1120, 651 tf'o Jstic3‚ cf. 653, 937 ;
744 quim ti'z hblmt‘nem5 789 ne? id ‹Jplserues3 2 38 52⁶ delum, cf.
751 3 460 εἴ ἴιί Illa esset, cs. 815-16.

(ii) when the unelided syllable does not bear ictus: 9 quc?
i'lllud 3 502 εἴ adquam (to be read si-y-aequom, cf. 578 εἴ Z'st
patilper); 471 nilcd'ncl (doubtful); 513 quia 1 zzz ἐς (tu emphatic,
cf. 379 fobe* ίιῖξ Ιιᾶκι) ; some instances under this head may be
due partly to loss of old ablative-ending -d‚ as 1028 (at
diaeresis) nssgds m} Ι essse, cf. 713 (where hiatus may be justified
on other grounds). Most of the instances under this head
have suffered unnecessary emendation, since it has been
denied by certain authorities that hiatus may occur aster

¹ This phrase, here and subsequently, must be taken to mean: final

syllables ending in a vowel, a diphthong‚ or -m preceded by a vowel, when
they occur before an initial vowel-sound.
