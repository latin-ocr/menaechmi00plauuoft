circle of superior persons—cf. Pollio's depreciation of Livy.
Cicero both praises Plautus directly, and flatters him indirectly
by the numerous reminisccnces of l’lautine phrase and usage
which find place in his Leller53 and it may bc conjectured that
Caesar recognized in the more popular playwright that comica
uis of which he deplores the lack in Terence. The average
Roman's sentiments were probably voiced by the epitaph which
Varro quotes ι

Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,
Scaena est deserta, dein Risus, Ludus, Iocusque,
Et qumeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrimarunt.

3. DATE or PLAY AND AUTHORSHlp or ORIGINAL

It is impossible to arrive at any certain conclusion with
regard to the date at which the Menaechmi was first produced.
The only passage on which even a doubtful theory can be based
is ll. 408-12 Syracusis . . . ubi . . . regnator. . . nunc IIiero est.
If this passage is an original addition, it was probably inserted

between 216 and 214 B.c.‚ and is one of Plautus’s earliest
efforts. On the other hand, the excellence of the play seems
to postulate long practice and experience on the part of the
playwright‚ and it is unlikely that the Romans had much
stomach for light farce during the early years of the Second
Punic War. We are lest then with the probability that Plautus
took the passage as it stands from his original, Qh must have
been either (i) a drama of the New Comedy produced between
270 and 215 B.c. (the period of Hiero II's reign), or (ii) a play
of Epicharmus 3 in this case the reference in l. 412 would beto
