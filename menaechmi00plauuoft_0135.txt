571 at edepol nos tibi in lumbos linguam atquc oculas in salum, a
retort to the wish deciden'ntfemt'na uobis in talos uelim. Edd. who
prefer the rendering ‘through its socket’ compare Stat. Theb. i. 5 5
manibusque cruentis Pulsat inane solum, where, however, solum is
now generally taken as = ⁴ the ground ’.

158. licet gives assent to a request ; cf. 213, 224, and le. 1212-
26, where it occurs in this sense fifteen times in succession.

159. leonino cauo: cs. Ter. l’lzorm. 744 sonclusam lm· habeo
uxoren! {aenam-

160. εὖ edepol : eu in conjunctior] with edepol, hercle, ecastor, &c.
(not to be confused with eu! = Gk. εὖ, cf. 174, 176), expresses
surprise or indignation, and at the same time introduces an assertion;
cf. 316, 908. For hiatus aster interjections cf. 316, 640, 872.

ne: here an affirmative particle (= Gk. ναί) ; see 604 note.

esses: potential ; either ‘you would (now) be . . .’ (sc. si
agitator esses), cf. Cas. 811 ; or, · you would have made . . .’, imperf.
for pluperf. as in Mil. 28—30.

agitator: in the chariot-races at the ludi Circenses a driver
frequently looked behind him to see whether the next man was
pressing him. ·

161. quidum ’ἶ -dum strengthens the interrogative adverb ; cf. its
use as an enclitic attached to imperatives, e. g. agedum, lacedem,
cedodum; cf. 265, 348, 386. For qui (adverbial ablative) interroga-
tive cf. 396, (indirect) 337; exclamatory, 428, 451.

162. quid ais? ‘look here ’, a formula used to draw attention to
a new point, cf.914; so audin 310. Peniculus takes the question

, aio . . . nego, ‘ say Yes and No to ’; cf. 634, and Ter. Eun. 252,

nec÷aw.

164-5. Niemeyer fills the lacuna thus : facere coniecturam <tecum ?
PE. Eloquar recle tibi Cocli quid sit quasi coquorum) captum sit

⁴ collegium; ‘1³11 tell you of what sort the dish is just as correctly

as if you had called in a whole Board of Cookery.' This is not
justified by the traces in A (see App. Crit.)‚ but makes good sense ;
de odore would naturally suggest cooking to Pen.

165. captum: probably used here as in the phrase iudicem
(arbitrum) capere.

166.- quid olet? Ussing connects these words paratactically
with odorare.

apstines'? either transitive (sc. nasum), or intr. (sc. odorari).
