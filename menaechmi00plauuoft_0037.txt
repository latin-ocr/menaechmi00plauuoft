all feet but the fourth and eighth (they are allowed in thc
seventh).

(ii) The rule stated in D. (c), regarding substitution in the
fourth foot when followed by diaeresis, is observcd in the
eighth foot as well. In other words neither a dactyl nor
a proceleusmatic is allowed in the final foot.

(c) Neglect of the diaeresis-mle is less rare. When it occurs
there is a caesura in the fourth or fifth foot‚ as well as
permission of any substitute in the fourth foot (cf. 977 in
this play).

(d) A proceleusmatic is rare except in the first foot (cf. 1 19)
and the fifth (eg. in 773-4‚¹ 978); it occurs in the second
ln 977·

(e) In this play, with the exception of a single line (1007)
occurring in a boisterous passage, the Trochaic Octonarius
appears only in Cantica proper (eg. 119, 590-1, 594, 77 3—4‚
977-82 98²)·

(s) This metre is not often employed by English writers, but
an example may be found in

Charlotte, 1 having Ι seen his Ι body ΙΙ borne be1f6re her Ι on
a Ι shutter,

Like a Ι we'll-conlducted Ι person, Η went on 1 cutting Ι bread
and 1 butter.

F. A detailed analysis of the metres employed in the Cantica
proper is beyond the scope of the present edition 3 but a few
remarks may be of use. Besides the Iambic Septenarius and
the Iambic and Trochaic Octonarii, shorter iambic and
trochaic metres are not uncommon in the Cantica, usually
appearing in conjunctior] with other rhythms ς but most frequent
are systems of which the metrical basis is either
