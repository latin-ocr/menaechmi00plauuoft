MENAECHMI

f{Dee-n. )1286 (a threat) with Asin. 439 (an expression of satis·
action .

473—4. pro di: cf. 957, 1001 ; Ter. Ad. 447. pro in these cases
is followed by a vocative. Where interjectional pro is followed by
acculs. there is an ellipse of a verb, e. g. pro nostram fidem, sc.
imp oro. Ι

quoi homjini: for the hiatus cs. 374, 786, 789.

476. Hiatus at a strong pause in sense, accentuated by ehiasmus.
Warner tr. ‘Such cheam, such a dinner, such kinde entertain-
ment Ξ

477. hanc : sc. pallam.

heres: here in the archaic sense of ‘possessor ³ 3 cf. 62; Bacch.
849 exheredem secero uitae.
erit: sc. Erotium.
l478. exaudire clanculum, ‘hear clearly from my biding-
p ace ’.

479. de parti mea: he has caught the word heres, 477, which

he takes in the other sense. cf. 493.

parti: cf. 492 apsenti. The original ablative-ending of I-stems
was -ῖιί, becoming —z‘ by loss of the -d3 consonant stems at first
availed themselves of this ablative-ending (cf. 1020 temperi3 Capt.
914 car7zz'; and uirtutes on the tornb of a Scipio of date 130 Β. C.) ;
later the instrumental and locative termination -ὄ (= -ῖ) competed
with this I—stem abl.—ending‚ not only in consonant Steiris, but also in
I-stems‚ till in Classical Latin only a few I-stem nouns preferred
abl. in -z'; in Plautus, however, we always find sorti, clai, naui,
&c. See Lindsay‚ Lat. Lang„ pp. 390—1.

480. The double iambic ending is permitted when, as here, there
is an elision after the fourth foot. .

481. quoniam here temporal = quom iam. The addition of -z'am
makes the pres. the appropriate tense; see note on 24 postquam
mm.

482. errare: sc. eam: for the omission cf. 347, 461, 524.

Ι res: an euphemisni, ‘intrigue'. Fr. une affirm. Scan res
esim ἔΙα; cf. 448—9.

483. dixerat: cf. 717 quemquem aspexerat. The pluperf. indic.
is used in Latin ofthe best period to express indefinite frequency:
cf. Cic. Verr. 11. v. ΙΙ. 27 cum rosam uiderat, lum incipere uer
arbitrabatur. Later the pluperf. subj. gradually displaces it.

485. bene fui, ‘had a good time’; colloquial use of an adverb
with esse 3 cf. 1003 Alere. 583 pulchre ut simus3 morffoften the verb
is impersonal, as 603, 6213 Cisl. 59 male milei est; ancl beneest
(passim). Menaechmus, like the first Duke of Marlborough‚ was
‘thrifty in his vices ¹.

486. turbare, ‘upset him ', ‘ give him fits ³. Ι

487. The scansion qum dis is here to be preferred to quid (Τις,
as a double iambic ending is avoided except under certain con-
