36 INTRODUCTION

The apparent anomalies of Plautine prosody are due, then,
partly to his chronological position midway between the age of
the native accentual prosody and that of the exotic strictly
quantitative prosody, and partly to bis endeavour to effect a
compromise between the latter and the natural stressed pro-
nunciation of Latin.¹ These important facts were not realized
until a comparatively recent date. For long ages the prosody
of Roman Comic drama remained a riddle apparently insoluble.
Nor was the solution forthcoming as long as no canons were
recognized except those of the Augustan age. Ritschl was the
first scholar to put the metres of Plautus on a rational basis.
Hc first pointed out that, though Plautus²s metre was quanti-
tative, some regard was taken of the accent which words bore
in ordinary speech 3 and that the words which fall into the
inetrically unaccented parts of any line are generally ‘ sentence-
enclitics ³, i. e. words of no special importance. Ritschl's
theories were confirmed and further developed by his successors
in the field of Plautine research, who demonstrated that the
shortening of long syllables, the occurrence of hiatus,² and the
other apparent irregularities of Plautine prosody, followed
definite laws of their own ς and that these laws were generally
to be explained in part by the influence of ordinary pronuncia-
tion, in part by that of metrica] ictus. Among the leading
scholars of the Ritschelian school may be mentioned Langen
and Klotz, whose conclusions, still further elaborated by Brix‚⁸
were introduced to English students by the labours of Sonnen-
schein.⁴ Their explanation of the most striking peculiarity of

d ¹ ΞΓῘζιε speech of his characters had os necessity to reflect that of every-
av ie.

² Ritschl himself failed to see that the frequency σφέας in Plautus
reflected a peculiarity of ordinary speech. One school o' his followers
strove to eliminate hiatus from the text of Plautus by indiscriminate
emendation. Editors devoid of Bentley‘s knowledge, taste, or acumen
strove to out-Bentley Bentley. W. Wagner is the worst offender.
