MENAECHMI

auctions (cf. 1156 conclamari) as well as conducting thern.. Cf.
Cicero’s metaphorical use of the term, adAtt. xiii. ¹²·.² ngamanam
(his speech stro Ligario) praeclare uendidisti (advertised) ε posthac
quidquid scripsero, libi praeconium deflram.
nunciam qualifies canchvmzri, but is Bergk's reading is accepted

(see App. Crit.) it qualifiessore. The word = munci-am ; see on 962.

1156. fore quidem dieseptumh ‘ yes, as taking place this day
week ’. For dz‘esesstumz· cf. Pers. 260 ; die as ‘ tempora! locative ’
has in agreement with it an adj. in the locative case ; cf. 1157 mane
. seplumi ; illast. 881 die crastini, and the ending of the first com-
ponent in postridie, quotidie. See also 1005, note.

1 157. Menaechmi : sc. bonorum. Messenio here invites tlze
audz'ence to the auction ; cf. 880-1.

sane, ‘without fail '. Alliteration and jingle are part of the
auctioneer’s stock-in-trade.

1158. supellex usually means all movable property except
uestis and aurum ; probably these are included here, as Men. Ι was
leaving the country.

fundi: country estate with house attached3 aedes: town house3
cf. Digr. l. 16. 211. To avoid hiatus Havet reads praedia, aedes,
supposing fundi to be an error for fidi or fluidi, i. e. praem‘dia
(cf. praeuides = praedes), final -α having dropped before aedes.
(The assonance would certainly be suitable bere ς cf. note on sane,
1157.) See, however, Introd. 7. IV. D. d, p. 56.

1 159. quiqui licebant, ‘ at whatever price they will setch ’ (lit. be
bid for) ; quiqui probably represents the locative of quisquis, and
= quanticumque ; see 549, note.

praesenti pecunia: as in modern auctions. For the phrase
cf. Cic. ad Att. ii. 4 praesentem pecuniam solui imperaui.

1160. uenibit : retention of original long quantity here is due to
pause before comic παρὰ προσδοκίαν.

quoque etiam : colloquial redundance. Brix denies, however,
that the phrase is ever tautological in Plautus, and says that here
quoque = ‘ besides' (the other goods), and eliam = ‘actually ',
‘even ’. See also note on 1161 quinquagesies.
emptor: participial, = empturum cf. 274 pransoribus.
1 161. uix credo, &Q : spoken in a depreciatory tone z ⁶ I scarcely

think the whole sale will bring him in as rnuch as—five million.¹
The joke lies in the παρὰ προσδοκίαν.

capiet: sc. Menaechmus I.
quinquagesies: (for the usual quinquag’ s probably a
vulgarism introduced metri gratia 3 cf. Joe Gargerffss'brchitectoora·

leoral) = quinquagies centena milia sestertium, nearly A45,000‚
reckoning the sestertius at 2}AE When sums of money are men-

tioned, a numeral adverb with sesteriz'zim denotes so many hundred
thousand sesterceS, a distributive numeral with sestertia so many

thousand sesterces. Leo suggests quinquagesimas (sc. partes), i. e.
