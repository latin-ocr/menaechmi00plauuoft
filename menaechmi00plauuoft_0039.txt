voice-pitch or musical tone.¹ Furthermore, in thc Latin
tongue as spoken, quantity was considerably influenced hy
accent² or stress, while the absence of stress in Greek resulted
in the retention of original quantities and therefore in a quanti-
tative prosody governed by fixed and strict rules.

The Roman Comic Dramatists‚ feeling the need of some
medium of expression more finished and artistic than the
rough accentual metre of early Latin verse, turned naturally to
their models‚ the plays of the New Greek Comedy, for their
metres as well as for their plots and characters, and adopted in
its broad outlines the Greek quantitative prosody. At the
same time, however, in the determining of quantity they were
influenced largely by the practice of every-day speech3 they
regulated quantity (especially the quantity of syllables long by
position and of the final syllables of iambic words) rather by
the natural word· and sentence—aecem than by the strict rules
followed by Greek poets. Ennius, who borrowed the Greek
hexameter, approximated more closely, in his treatment of
quantity, to Greek models.³ The final development is
reached in the precise quantitative prosody of the Augustan
poets and their imitators, who followed strict rules that were
to some extent at variance with the natural rhythm of the
Latin tongue.‘ In this respect Plautus and Terence may
be called more truly Latin poets than Virgil, Horace, or
Ovid⁶; they were adapters rather than imitators of Greek
prosody.

¹ The accents printed in our modern Greek texts denote such tone-
variations only.

² The term ‘aecent‘‚ in respect of Latin and other I.-E. langnages (except
Greek), denotes stress.

‘'bEnnius himself, however, retains features of the older prosody in his
iam ic verse.

⁴ Striet quantitative prosody is alien to other 1.-E.1anguages‚ eg. our
own; see for instances Tennyson's Attempls at Classic Matres in Quantity.

⁵ Virgil and Horace show traces of the earlier prosody, especially in their
more colloquial poems, i.e. the Eclogues and the Satires and Epistles
respectively. Similar traces appear in Catullus, PropertiuS‚ and Ovid.
