MENAECHMI

38. surruptum : see on Arg. 2.

T39. 'llt'he sffiasssion T cilrlegmr‘zl'¹ (not found elsewhere) and the scansion

ἄνέη ι’ wit iatus are ot unsatis actor .

4ο, 41. immutat . . ‚ita . . . dilexit: loyose paratactic construc-
tion for ila dilexit ut z'mmulauerit; cf. 94-5, 102--3.

4ο. huic : disyllabic ; Prologus is speaking as if he were in
Syracuse3 cf. 49.

huic . . . alteri = illum alterum os 28, i. e. Sosicles.

41. illum . . . alterum ε the original Menaechmus (Ι), now
of Epidamnus.

42. illius: Menaechmus. illi: Sosicles. The pronouns are
very clumsily used.

nornen indit illi . . . Menaechmo ε i. e. calls him Men.
Menaechmum might also have been used ; but cf. 1068. The phrase
nomen indere is used frequently by Livy, e. g. xxi. 31. 4 mediis
campis Insulae nomen inditum.

45—6. Cf. 10 and 22. illius and illum are to be taken as referring
to the puer surruptas.

46. clamore . . . flagitarier: i. e. ‘cried’ as missing by the
public crier (praeco), who served the purpose of our advertisement
columns and police notices. Edd. quote Petron. 92 iuuenis non ·
minore clamoris z'ndlgnatioue Gilona flagitabat. Petron. 97 gives
an actual notice ofthe sort3 the missing boy is described, and a
reward offered sor information. Brix suggests that there is a play
on the other meaning offlagitarier‚ ‘ dunned by creditors ’3 but to
take it thus necessitates referring illius and illum to the auos. The
archaic passive infinitive form in -z'er is fairly common in Plautus
and Terence ; cf. 913, 1005.

uidi : used of senses other than sight ; cf. Verg. Aen. iv. 490
mugire uidebis Sub pedibus terram et descendere montibus ornos;
Catull. lxii. 9 canent quod uisere par est.

47. mox: when the actual play comes on. iam nunc: now
already (but nunciam = ‘ at once, immediately ' 3 cs. 1155).

48. This reiteration may be excused on the ground that it was
necessary to impress upon the audience a fact without which the plot
was unintelligible.

49. pedibus ε in the double sense of ‘ feet ’ and ‘feet in verse ’ ;
for a superior joke of the same kind cf, Shakespeare, As You Like
lt, iii. 2 ε Res. ‘ Some of them had in them more feet than the verses
would bear. Cel. That’s no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
Ros. Aye, but the feet were lame,' &Q V

50. examussim: this adverb is found in Plautusffld Appuleius
only. The amussis was a plank used probably like the modern
plank and plumb-line.

disputem: ordinary meaning ‘ discuss pros and cons’ not
applicable here ; perhaps used in sense ‘make it clear on all
sides ’ ; cf. original meaning of pulo (‘ to prune ³) and putus.
