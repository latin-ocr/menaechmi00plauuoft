MENAECHMI

103. standumst: usually a guest could help himself without

rising from the lectus.

petas ε for this mood, parallel to Gk. subjunctive with ἐάν,
cf. 95, and see Sonnenschein’s leudem, note on 1021. Tr. ‘ should
you seek ’.

104. iam . . . multos: cf. A sin. 428 lriduom ἠθι- anunm leud. 137,
ἂρ, and our colloquial, ‘ 1 haven't been there these three days’.

105. domi domitus sum: this, the MSS. reading, is taken to
mean, ⁶ I’ve been living the domestic lise at horne ¹, domitus being
regarded as a comic fourth-conjugation form such as we find in
Mil. 34 ne dentes dentiam. On the analogy, however, of Capi. 84
rum· rurant, and of a deponent form meror quoted by Nonius from
Varro, Lindsay suggests that a first-conjugation deponent form,
domatus, should perhaps be read here: a copyist would be likely
to change it to the more familiar-looking domitus. Vahlen suggests
dominatus snm, ‘I have been playing the host ’.

cum careis meis would naturally mean ‘ with my dear ones’
(i. e. children, δερ.) ; but Peniculus explains his use of the phrase in
the next line.

106. To him everything he has to pay for out of his own pocket is
dear; cf. Aul. 374—6, where the miser Euclio complains of the
dearness of provisions.

107. id quoque iam, ‘then there’s this further trouble ’ 3 id
stands in anticipatory apposition to the whole sentence3 so with
other neuter pronouns, e. g. istuc (‘ by the by') 5363 this is the real
construction of ulrum used as a disjunctive interrogative particle.

instruontur: his dainty dishes are drawn up like a regiment;
the table is the parasite's battlefield. The metaphor is continued
in deserunt. Cf. Capt. 158-64‚ where various dishes are compared
to various kinds of troops.

109. Menaechmum : thus the character is introduced to the
audience; cf. 180, 218, διο,

eccum stands for ecce÷lmm (i. e. lzmzc without the demon-
strative suffix -ce) ς for the construction see on 179—80.

110 seq. Menaechmus's wife follows him to the door to see where
he is going, but is soon (127) driven indoors by his abuse. For the
metres 110-34 see Schema Metrorum, p. 213 ; and on the metres
of Cantica generally see Introd. 6. II. F, p. 33.

110. sies : this form of the subjunctive was originally an optative
(gsz'es = εἴης, Sco). The influence of the forms simus, sitis (εεῖμεν,
εἶτε), led to the gradual disappearance of the e in simu, -es, -et, -ent.
See Lindsay's Captivi, 193 note.

inposque animi, ⁴ unable to control your feelings'; like
arpos, inpos is followed by the genitive of respect. Cf. the late use “
o inpudens.

111. esse odio supplies the passive, as odio habere the present
active, of odisse.
