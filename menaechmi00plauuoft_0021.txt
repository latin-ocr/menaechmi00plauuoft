THE STAGING OF THE PLAY 17

spectators stood, or sat on their own camp-stools, in the space
outside the orchestra.

The actual stage (proscaenium, pulpitum) was extraordinarily
long—some authorities say, 180 feet. Hence verisimilitude

was given to ‘ asides ', or to the sailure of a hidden character to
overhear soliloquies or conversations (cf. 478—9, 966 note), and

an actor could deliver a speech os considerable length while
passing from one end of the stage to the other (cf. 753 note).
The scenery was primitive and conventional. The background
usually represented two houses, with sometimes a passage
(angsportum), which might serve as a hiding-place, running
between them. The doors of these houses opened on to the
stage, and served as extra stage-exits. The stage itself thus
represented a street, and in the absence of any device, such as
the Greek ἐκκύκλημα, whereby the interior of a room could be
shown, every incident in a play had to be presented as taking
place in the street, though sometimes a character spoke into
a house from the doorstep (cf. 110, 351, 466). The same
background served for a succession of different plays and
a variety of different scenes (cf. Prologue 72-6). The main
exits from the stage were by the wings, and by convention the
left-hand exit (to the spectators' rzglzt) was supposed to lead to
and from the forum and town proper, that on the right hand
to and from the harbour. Characters arriving from foreign
parts thus entered R.1 (See also notes on ll. 226, 555, 562,
567, 700, 881, 966, 1049.) Subjoined is a plan showing the
