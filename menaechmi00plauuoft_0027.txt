MODERN DERIVA'FIVIQS 25

even the plot, beyond which his borrowing extended bnt little,
was by his skill recast in a sar more elaborate inonld. It is
not here proposed to enter into a detailed account os the
differences between the plot of the Camcdy and that os the
Asenaeclzmi; suffice it to say that Shakespcarc doubles the con-
fusion by the introduction of a second pair of twin brothers-—
the two Dromios,¹ slaves to the two Antipholuscs (whose
originals are the Menaechmus b1·ethren)-and introduces
a pathetic background for the story in the separation by
shipwreck of Aegeon and his wife, parents of the Anti-
pholuses. The final ἀναγνώρισις is thus a triple one. The
student is advised to read, side by side with this play,
Shakespeare's Comm'y, or at least the substance thereos in
Lamb’s Tales.²

It must be noted that Shakespeare derived his raw material,
not direct from Plautus, but partly from the Historie of Error
and partly frorn a translation of the fllenaeclzmi by ‘ W. W.'‚³
published in 1595, but, as is clear from the considerable
number os verbal resemblances between the Comedy and
W. W.'s translation, evidently seen by Shakespeare in manu—
script. The title-page of this work is reproduced overleaf.

This version, which was of course made· from an inferior
text, is very free, and in places contains gross errors; on the
other hand, it is spirited and brisk and amusingly quaint, as
may be seen from the few brief extracts for which there is space
in the Notes to this edition. Comparison of this translation

¹ The introduction of two pairs of characters resembling each other—
masters and slaves respectively—is evidently a reminiscenee os the Amphi-
truo, to which Shakespeare is also partially indebted sor that scene ol the
Comedy (111. i) in which Antipholus of Ephesus is lockcd out of his own
house while his brother dines within.

² The subject of mistaken identity was also utilized by Shakespeare in
T wclftlc Nzg’lzt.

⁸ Probably William VVarner, an Oxsord man and an Attorncy of common
Pleas. He wrote Albz'on's England (1586). It must he added that many
Shakespearian seholars doubt Shakespeare's having had necess to this

translation.
