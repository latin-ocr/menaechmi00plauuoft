602-3, 983—4. The general effect of the rhythm rnay be
illustrated by such lines as

or (b) the Bacchius (υ —' -); e. g. 571-9, 753-72, 966—71.
An exact illustration can hardly be obtained from English
verse. Less common are systems based upon the cretio

(—' υ -; cf. 112—13, 115-18, 580), or the choriambus
(Luna-3 cf. 110).

The apparent irregularities and inconsistencies of Plautine
prosody are for the most part to be explained by reference to
Plautus’s chronological position. Early Latin verse—written
in the native Saturnian metre ¹——and Latin popular verse of all
ages depended for its rhythm‚like the verse of all Indo-European
languages except Greek, upon word· and sentence-aecem, and
therefore upon quantity only indirectly. Greek prosody, on
the other hand, is wholly based upon quantity 2 whether natural
or artificial (i.e. determined by position). The reason why
Greek verse holds this anomalous position is that, while all
other Indo-European languages were and are stressed--one
syllable or more in each word being emphasized in pronuncia·
tion—‚ Greek was unstressed and admitted only variations in

¹ Atternpts have been made to prove that the Saturnian metre was
quantitative ; but the mass of authority, from Bartsch and VVestphal down
to Lindsay, is in favour of regarding it as accentual. According to the
generally accepted view the Saturnian verse consisted of two hemistichs,

the first containing three, the second two, stressed syllables, ictus coinciding
with stress. The commonest forms were of the type

or, prima incidit Clreris ΙΙ Prose‘rpz'na ptiar.

² By quantity is meant the time taken in pronouneing a syllable.

Rougiily speaking, a long syllable should take twice as long to pronounce
as a s ort one.
