of the same school.

While, however, 'l'erence's plays arc faithful translations ot
his models and reproduce the delicacy and subtlety of the
Attic spirit, Plautus‘s productions bear the unmistakable impress
of the adapter's hand. Not only does he sprinkle his plays with
allusions to Roman history, customs‚ and institutions‚ and with
Latin puns, jokes‚ and turns of speech, but the more boisterous
humour which is their distinguishing feature is peculiarly his
own. Employed about the stage in early life, he had had
opportunities of gauging the taste of the Roman populace, and
knew what broad comic effects were needed to keep a Roman
audience from strolling off to a rope-walking display or a dog-
fight3 cf. Ter. Hec. prol. 4, 33-42. His importance for us,
indeed, lies in the fact that, reflecting as he did a Roman
audience's well-fed jollity, coarseness, and appreciation of the
obvious, he was the most truly Roman of the Roman dramatists.
Terence had a more limited number of admirers-chiefly the
rich and cultivated Scipionic circle. In spite of this Plautus
enjoyed but moderate success during his lifetime 3 Terence, on
the other hand, was the petted favourite of the few. In the Rome
of those days, as in our own country down to the time of Pope,
it was more profitable to court the patronage of the great than
to win the favour of the mutable rank—scented many.

But that Plautus’s work gained general, if posthumous,
appreciation is evident from the numerous revivals of his
plays during the period 150—50 B.c. Τ he harsh criticisms of
Horace¹ seem to reflect the estimate of a rather ‘precious’
