immigrants; the first Greek physician came to Rome about the
beginning of the Second Punic War (Pliny, H. Ν. xxix. 1. 6). As
many of them were pompous charlatans, they were frequently
satirized by the Comic Dramatists. Here Plautus is laughing at
the habit (not unknown to-day) of certain doctors of boasting about
their aristocratic clientele. The joke is pointed by the fact that
Aesculapius and Apollo were the gods of healing. Scan ᾶῖί.

887. fabrum: there is no need to suppose that the Senex, by
a humorous error, takes Aesculapio, Apollini as referring to the
gods’ statues, · the joke is more simple, · the doctor has boasted of
