¹4 INTRODUCTION

ordinary domestic slave (cs. 218 note), while the cooks in the
Aulularia, hired from the forum (Aul. 280—1), are evidently
slaves kept for hiring out. their sees going to their owner
(cf. Aul. 309—10‚ where Anthrax asks whether Euclio could
be induced to purchase his and his fellow-cook's freedom); it
has therefore been conjectured that the Affeuaeclemi and the
Aulularia were derived from plays of Poseidippus. But seeing
that Anthrax and Congrio are slaves, we may safely infer, what
on general grounds we should naturally suspect, namely, that
such hired cooks were almost invariably slaves (cf. the status of
physicianS, and see 951 note) 3 and in the case of the Casina
and the Mercator, where such cooks appear, the author of the
originals is known to have been not Poseidippus but Philemon.
Finally and conclusively, the statement in Athenaeus (which
after all may not be intended seriously) is directly disproved by
the appearance of a domestic slave-cook Syriscus in the newly-
discovered Epitrepontes of Menander; in fragments, too, of
other N ew Comedy dramatists cooks bear names, such as Syrus,
Cario, &c., of the type given only to slaves (cf. note on
Messenio under heading Personae). On other grounds, how—
ever, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Poseidippus‚
who wrote a play entitled Ὅμοιοι, and who was alive during
Hiero II’s reign, may have furnished the model from which
Plautus derived the illetzaeclzmi.

The amusing errors arising from confusion of twins exactly
resembling each other were evidently a favourite plot-basis with
dramatists of the Middle and N ew Comedy ; plays with the title
of Δίδυμοι are ascribed by ancient authorities to six Greek comic
dramatists, a Δίδυμαι to Menander, and an Αὐλητρὶς ἢ Δίδυμαι
to Antiphanes. Of the six authors of &QQ however, only
one, namely, Euphron, was a Ν ew Com edy writer and flourished
during Hiero II's reign. The central idea of this play and its
predecessors is one rich in possibilities of comic incident; it is
therefore not surprising to find it a favourite plot-basis of comic
