MENAECHMI

that it was restored to the text, first in the wrong place, before
1029 (owing to another homoeoteleuton, 1044 quo uolet, 1029 quo
uoles), and then in its original position. The most serious difference
of reading between (a) and (b) occurs after excludunt foras (1040),
where (a) gives uel ille qui se petere modo argentum. modo qui
seruam se meum Ι] esse aiebat. quem ego modo emisi manu, while
( b) gives etiam hic seruam esse se meum aiebat quem ego emisi manu:
it will be noticed that the last nine words of (b) are almost identical
with the last ten of (a). From the traces that remain in the Ambrosian
palimpsest, it is clear that that MS. gives ll. 1037—43 in their right
position only, but omits 1042 and 10428, So much for the facts;
three suggested elucidations may be given. (1) Lindsay suggests
that the omission of 1042—42a in A and (b) was due to homoeote-
leuton (emisi manu 1041 and 104222)‚ and that the variation of reading
between (a) and (b) arose from the lines having originally been
arranged as he gives them in the text. According to this arrange-
ment ltic . . . quem ego emisi manu will be contrasted with aliz·
1040, and uel ille will mean ‘even he ⁷. Objections are that the
passage thus displays repetition to the point of incoherence; that
hic 1041, ille 1042, is 1043, all refer to the same person; and that
uel ille should naturally mean ‘ sor instance, that fellow' (cf. 873⁰).
(2) As elsewhere the readings of (a) are inferior to those os (b), we
may here adopt the reading of (b) with the slight change of esse se
meum to se meum esse, and delete lines 1042—423, the reading of (a),
as being a clumsy interpolation made up from 1041 and 1043.
This would give a triple contrast between alii 1040, hic . . . quem
ego emisi manu 1041, and socer et medicus 1046, ll. 1043-5 being
a parenthesis. (3) We may with Niem. prefer the reading os (a)
here, and suppose that uel ille introduces a particular example of
a general statement given in a missing line contrasting in sense
with 1040. In the confusion of the double restoration, such a line
as N iem. suggests, alii appellant me e'um quinon sum, e‘t subueniunt,
adiuuant, may well have dropped out after 1040 owing to similarity
of beginning. Niem. further conjectures that etiam ln‘c of (b) may
be a corruption of words omitted before seruam in 1042 as it
stands in (a), and proposes to insert etiam ignotus milti aster [mado]
argentum [modo] qui, deleting each modo (sor a similar corruption
in P cf. 495). If both suggestions are adopted, the passage 1040—3
will stand thus:

1040 alii me negant eum esse qni snm alque excludunt f0ra53

1041 (aliilappellant ξ me ἐῆν] qui f non sum, 1 thltenz'ttnt,

104222 seruam se meum esse aiebat, quem εἴρῃ modo emisi manu,

1043 is ait se, ἃς.

This arrangement would give the sense required, without re-

petition ; there would be a triple conti-ast, alii . . . alii . . . socer et
