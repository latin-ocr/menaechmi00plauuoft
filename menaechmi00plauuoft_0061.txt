PROSODY 57

except in the case of me and te, and a few fixe-d legal and
commercial phrases: it may, however, be an additional
justification of an hiatus allowed on other grounds. It may
here be remarked that, as will have been obvious, in a con-
siderable proportion of the cases quoted under C, Ι), and E,
several grounds combine to justify hiatus, as for instance in
431 iam selqua‘r tc³; Ι latine uofflo etiam Ι τοφιίοζιμιί (pause with
chiasmus, diaeresis, loss of A), or in 546 immo Ι cedo (ips Ι le' 3
&gb Ι post tibi! reddam Ι duplex (pause with chiasmus, caesura,
loss of -d).

1⁵¹. Some authorities state that hiatus was allowed by Plautus
before certain common words beginning with lz-, especially
homo, lzic, habeo and their inflexions. The true explanation
of apparent instances of this rule is probably that such words
frequently occurred in common word-groups wherein ordinary
pronunciation allowed hiatus. An examination of instances
in this play shows that most apparent cases of this rule can be
referred to other causes: e. g. the instances in 374, 379, 47 3-4,
744, fall under A. (a); that in 82 under A. (b); those in 903,
1061, under B. (a); that in 406 under C. (a); that in 89
(doubtful) under C. (b); those in 316, 640, under D. a. i3
that in 713 under D. a. ii, D. c. i, and E. Of the cases
remaining, in 489, 709 βᾶὲΐίὶΙᾶυι ΖιὸηιῑηΙιζς is obviously a popular
term of abuse invariably thus pronounced; in 223 ὅτίό Ι Ιιὸυιῖηᾶῑιι
may possibly reproduce popular pronunciation: but see note
ad loc.

G. A few instances of hiatus occur, in the MSS. of this
play, which cannot be referred to any of the above rules, and
probably indicate corruptions in the text: namely in 13 (un-
metrical), 292 έᾳκῑΙιῖέηι i'rzlsanum eslse, 428 ἒῒιόένη Ι ῗὲηὸΙναύίίΙαν,
446 plus trilgr‘ntffi Ι tinnis, 525 (unmetrical), 558 dil mila-¹ Ι ἐκ
me Ι sciat, where hiatus would be possible only if mz‘lzi could
here be scanned as a pyrrhic: see B. (a). In all these cases
satisfactory, if not certain, emendations have been proposed:
