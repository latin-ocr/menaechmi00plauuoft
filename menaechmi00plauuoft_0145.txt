COMMENTARY: LINES ²62-93

see‘ Α p. Crit., to which add Onions's excellent prin· idm mnm'tmc
‹Ie-cim ulan! (confusion of -ιιε and deu, and haplography).

277. opsonatu redeo: cf. 288, Cas. 7¹9· For historic present
with priusquam cf. Cur.. 637p17'11'qu11m moritur, milti dedit.

278. di te amabunt: formal reply to a greeting.

279. Leo restores thus : quis-quir sum ‚³² mm lu sris, Menaechme,
quis ego sim? (better, perhaps, quisquis ega sim? nescis, &cd
which would give sense required ; but see App. Crit. The eye os
the scribe of P jumped fron] quisquis 278 to (suis 279.

280. Hiatus at change of speakers coincident with caesura: or
scan ubi ; cf. T ruc. 506.

conuiuae: plural because the parasite = octa homines, 223.
For colloquial omission of verb cf. Cas. 542 ubi lua uxor?

282. Brix gives cerle . . . homo to Menaechmus: see App. Crit.,
and cf. 288—93. The words, if spoken by the cook, are an aside;
see 309 note.

283. dixin = nonne dixi: nonne is rare in Plautus, but is found
occasionally before a vowel or Ιι, e.g. Amph. 407; its place is taken
by -rte, non, or satin, or even ecquid (cf. 146).

284. The Ambrosian palimpsest here shows traces of a line which
does not appear in the P group.

286. Messenio takes Peniculum in the sense of ‘ clothes-brush’.
which, like a good valet, he has in his handbag.

287. numero: usually ‘on the instant'; here ‘too soon'; cf.
Poen. 1272 qur numero estis mortui .?

289. porci: a pig was the usual scapegoat among the Greeks
and Romans, and was offered not only as an expiation for crime,
’ but in cases of madness‚ which was regarded as a divine punish-
ment. The conventional cure was hellebore, procured chiefly at
Anticyra on the Corinthian Gulf ; Horace refers to both expiation
and cure, Sat. ii. 3. 164 immolet aequis Hic porcum Laribus . . .
Namjget Anticyram; cf. Aesch. Eum. 283 καθαρμοῖς ἠλάθη χοιρο-
sev-duom.

290. sacres: archaic and religious variant of sacri, as impetrire
sor impetrare.
sinceri: pigs ten days old were considered puri (free from
blemish) and therefore fit for sacrifice, Varro, de R. R. ii. 4. 16.
nummeis: i. e. at a didrachm apiece ; cf. 2¹9·
291. Scan ιἰἵόἔ ίέ; cf. 348, 1106, and see Introd. 7. 1. B. b. ii.
292. Better scanned with hiatus at caesura, as the word-accent
falls on the penultimate syllable of insanum. Lorenz proposes
insane insanum with elision of nam; cf. Aul. 314 parce parcumf
but this makes ictus conflict with word-accent. The hiatus is
possibly due to emphasis; cf. Introd. 7. IV. D. d, p. 56.
certo scio: in Classical prose pro cert0; Cicero uses the
colloquialism in letters, e. g. ad Att. iv. 3. 1 attere te certo sci-0.
293. molaetu’s: cf. elocutu's 1723 see Introd. 7. Ι. D. e. ι, p. 46.
