(iii) when two iambic words occur together in a word-group
accented as a single word; e. g. 328 mala'm crucem,
750 patre‘m meum.¹

(g) Caesura² must occur either in the third foot (pent-
hemimeral⁸) or in the fourth (heptheniinieral³)3 the pent-
hemimeral is far the commoner.⁴ On the question of hiatus
at caesura see Introd. 7. IV. C. b.

(h) The Iambic Senarius was used in Roman Comedy as
the ordinary metre of Diverbia‚ i.e. narrative passages and
spoken conversation or soliloquies of a quiet type (see Introd. 4)'.
The action of the Menaechmi is so rapid that less than a third
of it is written in this metre. Usually the proportion of Senarii
is larger.

The great Ι World-vl'cltor’s vicltor wssl Ι be seen Ι no more

B. The Iambic septenarius (= Greek Iambic Tetrameter
¹ Catalectic). “

(a) This is a line of seven and a half iambic or quasi-iambic
feet.

(b) It is a general rule, to which there are very few excep-
tions, that a diaeresis ⁵ must occur between the fourth foot and
the fifth. In this case the line must be regarded as falling into

¹ See also note ad loc. ; and on word-groups consult Introd. 7, pp. 38-40.

² A caesura is a break, occurring within a foot, between two words

³ Penthemirneral = occurring aster the fifth half-scot ; hepthemimeral
= occurring after the seventh half—soor.

⁴ A caesura might simultaneously occur in any other foot or feet.

⁵ A diaeresis is a break, occurring at the end of a foot, between two words,
