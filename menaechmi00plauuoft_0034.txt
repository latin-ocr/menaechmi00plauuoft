30 INTRODUCTION

two hemistichs¹ to the extent that the fourth foot must be
a pure iambus3 and may be so regarded to the extent that
hiatus may occur at the diaeresis and that syllaba anceps may
occur at the end of the fourth foot (i. e. a pyrrhic may in the
fourth foot be reckoned as an iambus).

(c) In the rare cases where there is no such diaeresis caesura
must occur in the fifth foot, and substitutes sor the iambus are
allowed in the fourth.

(d) With the exception mentioned in (b), any of the substi-
tutes enumerated in A. (b) above is permitted in any of the
complete feet, though a proceleusmatic is rare except in the
first and fifth (i. e. the first foot of each hemistich).

(e) A dactyl is seldom followed by an anapaest3 cf. A. (c).

(f) The final half-foot consists of a single syllable, long or
short (syllaba anceps). ’

(g) In this play the Iambic Septenarius occurs but rarely4=
and only in Cantica proper (133-4, 980).

(h) As an example of this metre in English may be quoted
The Brilton nevler terigivers’d, Η but was Ι for adlverse

drublbl'ng.

C. The Iambic Octonarius (= Greek Iambic Tetrameter
Acatalectic).

(a) This is a line of eight iambic or quasi-iambic feet.

(b) The final soot must be a pure iambus, though syllaba
anceps may occur at the end of the line (i. e. a pyrrhic may
there be reckoned as an iambus).

(c) Otherwise the rules are the same as for the Iambic
Septenarius (see B. b, c, d, e, above), except that neglectos the
diaeresis is less rare.2 Proceleusmatics occur, as there, chiefly
in the first foot (as in 987) or in the fifth (as ἱῐῑἺροΙ).

final -s before an initial consonant. See Introd. 7. Ι. D. b.
