agit, properat omnia.

Pen. {ears that Menaechmus will receive timely warning.
562. manufesto with opprimes.
hac: towards the lest of the stage (spectator's right), where
Men. 11 had thrown his corona; cf. 555.

563. Hiatus is perhaps due to the old ablative-ending -d3 cs.
526: but see Introd. 7. IV. D. d. It is better to suppose that l'en.
pauses for emphasis aster each horrible detail.

565. Scan quam Iamlam cf. 393 note, 695 qm'im habeam. For
constructgon os eccam without a verb see note on 179-80 ; contrast
its use, 5 7.

566. em, ‘there 3 ’ ‘⁷

uestigiis, ‘ by his traces ' ; we should say ‘ in his tracks ¹.

567. eccum . . . reum-titur: Menaechmus Ι enters L. as coming
from the forum; cs. 213, 596. So they are ready for him ; cf. 562.
The hiatus is due to the natural pause aster eccum coincident with
caesura; so Ales& 686.

569. male habeas : i. e. scold him. Warner tr. ‘that which ye
ever do 3 bayt him for life '.

sic censeo: assigned in old edd. to Matr.; but she would
hardly assent to Pen.’s idem quod semper, and sic censeo always
introduces or confirms the speaker’s own views ; cf. cist. 769.

570. Cf. Asin. 881 aucupemus ex insidit& clanculum quam rem
erana

g 571. For the metres of the following canticum (571—603) see
Schema Metrorum. The basis of the metre in 11. 571-84³ is the
bacchius (υ -’ -).

ut : exclamatory, as probably uti, 572.

maxume . . . moro : to be taken together and predicatively3

379 huiius mores morosi malos; Τ rin. 669 mores hominum moros
et morosos.

572. molesto atque multo: attributive ; the sentence then
runs: ‘ How utterly soolish (is) this troublesome and tiresome
fashion (that) we follow.' The reading of P is molestoque multum,
to be taken predicatively like maxume more, 571. Note the allitera-
tion. For multo cf. 316.

uti quique sunt optumi ε it is best to take uti as repeating ut
of 571, and quique as = quicumque (cf. Asin. 404 quisque obuiam
huic occesserit irato, uapulabit ; Mil. 156, 160, 460) : ‘ how especi-
ally is this custom practised by all our leading men '. Other-
wise take uti quique sunt opt. together (cf. Poen. 436 ut quisque
acciderat, eum necabam ilico), and supply ut exclamatory stom

571.
