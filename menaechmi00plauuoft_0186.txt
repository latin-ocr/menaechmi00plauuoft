MENAECHMI

hunc senem. ‚dedolabo . . . uiscera: ·1pposition between
whole and part.

859. osse fini: apparentlyszni' is used as a preposition(= tenus);
cf. Cato, R. R. 28. 2 postea operzto lem Ξ raca-'abus fini. Possibly‚
as Lindsay suggests, the phrase was 01iginally an abl. abs. (osse
fim, lit.‘ the bone being the limit ’). In classical Latinfine' is used
prepositionally with genitive (cf. again tenus), e.g. Ovid, Met. x.
536 fine genus uestem ritu succincta.

assulatim: cf. capt. 832. Hiatus at the diaeresis; see also
Introd. 7. IV. D. d, p. 56.
uiscera: everything inside the skin and outside the bones;
‘ flesh ’.
860. Scan ἕηῖηι τιὲξνθ.
illud: what he threatens. Senex here begins to edge away;
hence Men. must drive him down (862 seq.).

861. ut minatur : quasi-causal, ⁶ considering his threats '‚ ‘ such
are his threats ’ ; cf. Ter. Ad. 389—90 DE. eho an domist habiturus ‚2
SY. credo, ut est dementia.

faxit: subjunctive (originally optative) of S-aorist. Cf. Mil.
283 dim‘s‚ 316 empsim.
864. uetulum . . . edentulum: diminutives of contempt.
865. astiti in currum : ‘ pregnant ' construction.
iam stimulum: in manust: the punctuation of the present
text gives a staccato effect which interrupts harshly the rapid
rhythm of 863-4, 866—7. If stimulum is to be taken as a second
object of teneo, it is better (with Brix) to read iam stimulum
in manu, and to suppose that est was added by an ignorant copyist
who took stimulum for a neuter noun in the nom. Possibly, on the
other hand, there was such a neuter variant of stimulus (cf. 168
nasum = nasus), and we should read iam stimulum z'n manust : so
Lambinus.

866. appareat, ‘be plainly heard ’. Warner tr. ‘ Hait ¹ (= gee
up) ; ‘come ye wilde jades make a hideous noyse with your stamp-
in ε hait, I sa '.

g867.in1²lexaysit: the force of the perfect is ‘ be quite bent ’ ; the
line means: ‘Take heed that your tireless limbs bend themselves
double in swift trot’‚ a vivid expression to indicate high· stepping
action. Cf. Verg. 'Georg iii. 192 sinuetque aliern z uolumina
crurum. Note the mock tragic diction (pedum pernicztas) and
alliteration.

868. mihin . . . minare? Men. is probably praiffiffig about like
a horse, and the Senex is trying to humour him ; cf. Hor. Sat. i. 5.

869. qui stat, ‘ who stands his ground ', i. e. does not run away
like the Matrona. Sonnenschein's suggestion qui astat is un-
necessary.

870. capillo . . . deripit: just as Pallas prevented Achilles
