MENAECHMI

Amph. 444. There is considerable confusion in Latin between
masc. and neut. 0—stems3 as a rule the neuter gender is confined to
things without life, but names of parts of the body fluctuate between
masc. and neut.; in popular speech, as reflected by Plautus, dorsus,
collus, lmgus (111.) appear for the corresponding Classical neuter
forms. Generally speaking, in vulgar and late Latin the masculine
tends to oust the neuter in 0-stems.

inlutili: the last part ‘of the word is connected with the
supine-stem of lano.

169. lepide ut fastidis, ‘how divertingly you turn up your
