Canes: archaic form of nominative3 cf.l'71'n. 172, Phaedrus
ii. 4 2 feles

719. istaec, ‘that you commit. Ritschl, to avoid hiatus after
Ago, reads κῦφι e'‹ 0 {sltem ί]ἴιῖ; for this tautology cf. 721, 735, 738.
See, howexer, note on 389.

720. aetatem: acc. of duration, ‘all my life’ ; cf. Aszn. 274
aetatem uelim seruire: see also 675 note.

uiduam : used of a divorced woman ; cf. 113.
Hiatus here and ll. 737, 739—40, possibly marks utterance
checked by sobs‚ · see App. Crit. on 740.

721. The line repeats 719 and is itself tautological (istaec'.
lzfta.. ‚quae tusaczs;) a natural symptom of anger and agitation;

722. quid id ad me: sc. attmet ,9 cf. J oen. 1021 quzd istuc adme ,ἒ
ld anticipates the following pair of alternative questions, of which
the first lacks an interrogative particle ; cf. Rud. 1106 id. . . seruae ·
sint istae an liberae.

te nuptam : sc. esse, ‘ endure married life '.

725—6. non . . . patiar .. . quin: lit. ίΙ shall not endure not
to . . .' 3 the quin-clause is due to the sense of non patiar, which =
m'l me impediet3 cf. Ter. Heaut. 761-2 non possum pati quin tibi
caput demulceam.

726. quam . . . perferam: for ellipse of potius cf. Rua'. 1114
tacita homst mulier semper quam loquens. So 969 below quam =
tamquam. Subjunctive of rejected alternative ; cf. 3 32 potius quam

a.st‘es,1059; or perhaps perferam is fut. indic. ; see note on 332.

727. mea. ‚caussa, ‘sor aught I care'; cf. 1029. Gk. ἐμοῦ
’γ’ ἕνεκα.

728. dum with fut. indic. = quamdz'mc cf. 93.

729. at mihi negabas, &c.: the omission of the object seems
curious; see App. Crit. Niem. reads cit wiltz hanc (cf. 732). This
statement is not consistent with Men. I's words, 655- 7, but such
inaccuracy is natural on the part of an angry woman3 Ritschl,
however, reads haut for at, while Ladewig and F leckelsen, followed
by Wagner, completely di’sarrange the MSS. order of ll. 729-41.
Brix5 supposes that Matrona made an attempt to snatch away
the palla, which Men. frustrated3 hence at. Take mi‘lzz with
surrupuisse.

732. Scan tun tffbz lzdnoe see Introd. 7. Ι. Α. b. and cf. 1072.

734. istuc: in ‘anticipatory’ apposition tothe following sentence,

dragwing attention to it; ‘look herel' Cf. 107 uffuoque iam,
53 zs uc.

736. i, Decio ε she calls to a slave within the house.
737. ut ueniat: Langen, followed by Brix ⁵, holds that quaere
here = quaese (‘ ask ’ ε for constr. os quaeso see Bacch. 179) 3 but it

is probably better, with Sonnenschein, to take ut ueniat as final,
and quaere as ‘try to find ’.
