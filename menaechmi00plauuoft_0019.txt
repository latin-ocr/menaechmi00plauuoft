dramatists os many ages and countries (see ξ 5 below).
Plautus himself bases the plot of the :lmpln'lrmt on a super·
natural double resemblance: and Philocomasium's ‘dream' in
the Miles Gloriosus is a development of the same idea.

It has already been stated that Plautus adapted his models
with a very free hand, introducing Roman features without much
regard to consistency. The constant references to the infliction
of cruel punishments on slaves are entirely at variance with the
relations existing between Athenian masters and their slaves.
Slave-punishments were a conventional joke, at it were, os the
Roman comic stage, like mothers-in-law and drunkenness in
our own music-halls. Mommsen remarks on this point: ⁸ In
the endless abundance of cudgelling and in the lash ever
suspended over the back of the slaves we recognize very clearly
the household-government inculcated by Cato, just as we
recognize the Catonian opposition to women in the never-
ending disparagement of wives '. The abuse levelled at
physicians (see note on 88 5-6) and parasites is likewise probably
due to Catonian influence. Plautus further constantly intro-
duces allusions to Roman religion, to Roman customs,
institutions and offices, and to Roman topography 3 the result
is ‘a patchwork of Roman local tints distributed over the
Greek ground ’.

The Menaechmi surnishes 'many illustrations of Plautns's
method of treatment. To the Roman attitude towards slaves we
have references in 79-93‚ 249-51‚ 943 (caesum . . . sub furca),
951 (pendentem fodiam), V. vi; sels-assertive wives are depre-
ciated in I. ii, 766-71, and elsewhere. Roman religion appears
in the mention of the Cerealia 101, and of the proverbial
stealing of Jove’s crown 941 3 there are allusions to Roman
legal and socia] institutions in 96—7 (enslavement for debt);
451-9 (contiones) ; 571—95 (clientes, and Roman legal proce-
dure) 3 1028—33 and 1148-50 (manumission): notice also the
metaphor from the legion and adscnptim' 183—8. Roman
