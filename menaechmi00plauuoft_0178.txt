MENAECHMI

753. The Senex has entered L.‚ l. 747, and now totters slowly
across the stage to the centre‚ where his daughter and Men. 11
have been conversing; by the time he reaches his daughter (775)
Men. has moved away R. (cf. 777). As the Roman stage was very
long (cf. Introd. 4, ρ. 17), there was plenty of time sor him to
deliver this canticum as he approached. The halting, rather
jerky, bacchiac metre suits the old man’s gait. See Schema
Metrorum. ·

ut aetas mea est, &c.‚ ‘as (far as) my age allows‚ and in

so far as it is necessary to do so ’.
hoc usu' facto est: usus est takes the same construction as

opus est; lzoc may either agree with sacta, as Rud. 398 iam istoc
magis usus factost, or be nom„ as osten with neuter pronouns in
these phrases; cf. Amplz. 505 citius quod non factost usus fit
quam quod factost opus. For abl. of pass. partic. used thus

Cf·755{{·progrediri: so Bothe alters MSS. progredi, on metrical

grounds; for the form cf. Cas. 862 progrediri ; Pseud. 859 pro-
gredimino. Consonant-stems with the -YO suffix gave rise to
two classes of verbs; in one, -ἴ- predominated (third-conjugation
verbs in -z'0)‚ in the other, -ῐ- prevailed (certain fourth-conjugation
verbs). In O. Lat. the two classes were not clearly differentiated.
It is possible that we should here retain the MSS. reading and
take the first syllable of properabo as long (cf. profiteri 643 ; see
note there, and Lindsay, Lat. Lang. p. 590 ᾗ 45). The line would
then run gradzim pro'lferzz‘771, prb'gredz' prO'Jperdbo, and we may
suppose that each repetition of pra· was accompanied by a step
sorward with the aid of the scipio (856).

756. consitus: cf. Cat. 64. 208 caeca mentem caligine Theseus
consitus3 Verg. Aen. viii. 307 ibat rex obsitus aeuo.

757. onustum: sc. senectute3 cf. Merc. 671—3.

758. mers: this word also appears in the forms merx, mercis,
merces (cf. frux, frugis, fruges, stirps, stirpis, stirpes, &c.). In
these and similar cases the longer forms are the earlier (cf. Cas.
380 sortis). In popular speech x and hard s seem to have differed
little in sound, to judge by forms appearing in late inscriptions such
as milex, ariex, conius. See Ritschl‚ Opzcsc. ii. 652-6.

ergo is often used thus when a sentiment is repeated: ‘yes
(after all) it is a bad business '. Edd. take it here as = ἔργῳ, and
quote Mil. 1043, where, however, it has its usual meaning of
‘accordingly’ if we accept the conjecture deas forsseus at the
beginning of the line.

759. res . . . pessumas is taken as a single expression, and
hence can be qualified by another adjective without εἰς cf. 66
maxumam malam crucem, 849.

760. longu' sermost: indicative (in spite of si autumem) as in
the phrase longum est dicere, where we should say ‘ It would be
