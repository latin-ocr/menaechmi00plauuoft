DATF, AND ORIGINAL ¹3

mention in 1. 410 of Agathocles, Hiero II's immediate pre*
decessor, seems to be conclusive against this, and other
objections may be urged against the view that Epicharmus
provided the model (see below). It may be said in conclusion
that the passage 408—12 is not sufficiently serious to base
a theory upon (see 409—12, note), and that interna] evidence
seems to point to a date at which the poet’s powers were fully
developed.

From what Greek original Plautus derived the outline of the
” Menaechmi is not known. A now exploded theory ascribed
his model to EpicharmuS, the founder of Greek comedy proper,
who lived at the court of Hiero I of Syracuse, a patron of
literature, during the fifth century B.c. This view was founded
on the statement made in ll. 11-12 of the Prologue, Jzoc
argumentum . . . sc‘ct‘lt'ctksz'lan and seemed to derive further
support from Horace's remark in Epp. ii. 1. 58 (dicitur) Plautus
ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi. But in the latter
passage the point of comparison lies merely in the ease and
rapidity with which either author developed his plot 5 and the
words quoted from the Prologue mean nothing more than that
the story has a Sicilian background or concerns Sicilian folk.
Lastly‚ although Epicharmus, in spite of his early date, had
more in common with the New Comedy than with Aristophanes,
such fragments of his plays—mostly burlesques of mythological
legends—as we possess afford no support to this theory, nor is
there any certain instance of a Latin play based on any work
of his.

A more probable‚ though equally hypothetical view attributes
the original to Poseidippus‚ a dramatist of the New Comedy.
This theory is based upon a remark made by a character in
Athenaeus (Deipn. xiv. 6 58—9), οὐκ ἂν εὕροι τις δοῦλον μάγειρόν
τινα ἔν κωμῳδίᾳ πλὴν παρὰ Ποσειδίππῳ μόνῳ. In Plautus's plays
cooks are as a rule definitely represented as hired from the
