INTRODUCTION

es that the rhythm produced 'by the metrical ictus as

sule corresponds with the natural accentuation. Certain

features of ordinary pronunciation, which are reproduced in
Plautus's verse, may here be summarized ε

Ι. In many cases syllables which later poets scanned as long
were in ordinary speech pronounced as short, owing to the
influence of word-accent : e. g. (A) the accentuation, in ordinary
speech, of the first syllable in iambic words (or word-groups)
such as citimi, ma'ne, &c.‚ tended to the shortening of the final
syllable; (B) on the other hand, the stressing of the penulti-
mate in polysyllabic words (or word-groups) such as uoluptdtem,
senecttitem, &c., tended to the shortening of a long ante-
penultimate: these two rules explain most instances of the
so-called Law of Breves Breviantes. (C) A few unimportant
words of very frequent occurrence, such as ille and iste in
all cases, were normally unaccentuated in popular speech 3
when used emphatieally‚ however, they bore the usual accent
on the penultimate. (D) In rapid conversation final -s after
a short vowel was frequently dropped before an initial con—
sonant (e. g. nlmi' stulte), and before an initial vowel when
a participle in -us or adjective in -us or -is preceded es or est
(e. g. emortuost‚ tristest = tristis est: but see above, p. 39 (a),
and Ι. D. c below).

ΙΙ. Ordinary pronunciation slurred many words, in which
two or more vowels occurred in conjunction‚ in such a way that
the vowels coalesced (synizesis). Thus mab, bnt-us, α’ἴες were
frequently pronounced as monosyllables 3 tu—orum, ffimus, &c.,
as disyllableS. Cf. the old story about Caunias and caue ne
eas (i. e. eff} ne &35st

III. In certain word-endings which had become normally
short before the age of the Augustan poetS‚ the original long
quantity seems, in spite of the accent·influenee‚ occasionally to
have affected the pronunciation of Plautus’s day. This may be
