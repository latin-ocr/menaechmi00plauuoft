Β. Α long syllable may be (and often is) scanned as
short if the preceding syllable is short and the succeeding
syllable bears ictus :

(a) in polysyllabic words having tlic first syllable short,
the second long, and ictus on the third: here the second
syllable is treated as short, e. g. 259 ubldptd'lrii; 37 &racd-l
sas (contrast 408, 1097 Sjlrcicfflszkfl this example, however, as
occurring in the Prologue, may be a faulty imitation of Plautine
scansion ; instances of the shortening of vowels long by nature
occurring in a polysyllabic word are to be regarded as
doubtful.

(b) in word-groups wherein a bacchius¹ occurs: more de-
finitely, when of three consecutive syllables, belonging to two
or more words, the first is a short initial syllable, the second is
long, and the third bears ictus, the second syllable is commonly
shortened: either

(i) when it is long by position or long by both position and
nature, as 384 quid Ιιῡε 1 527, cf. 11²9-303 983 metum z'a' mvn·

perhaps this is a case of synizesis; cf. 588 clz‘Fns qui'ldam, and
see ΙΙ. b. below) 3 ²29 quasi cidu'e‘nflens 3 a double instance in
983* ῑᾶνέηί ηιὲίιῖιόηί ῑ’ Ιςῦίέηί ἔςῙςε. (In these combinations it
is in such a vast majority of cases the rule that the short
syllable which precedes the shortened syllable is an initial
syllable, that one regards with suspicion instances such as
152 habeliz‘mds titique Ιιάφιις the text is doubtful ; see notes
ad loa).

(ii) when it is long by nature only; chiefly in the case
of imperatives, as 1106 rbgci: Ι risponldebm 291 iub? te* f ς 348
