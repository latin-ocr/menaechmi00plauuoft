26 INTRODUCTION

verse of six feet as one of three¹ dipodies or double⁴feet
(μέτρα); strong ictus occurred once only in each dipody3 and,
though substitutes for the iambus (υ Λ) were. allowed in the
llrst soot os each dipody, yet in order to emphasize the iambic
metrical basis the last foot of each dipody (i. e. every even
foot) was kept invariably pure-nothing was allowed there but
an iambus: since there was no word-stress for ictus to conflict
with, this presented no difficulty. If the Roman eomic
dramatists had, in writing iambic verse3‚ observed this dipodic
law‚'² ictus must frequently have fallen on the* last syllable of
iambic worda though such words were in Latin normally pro-
nounced with a stress on the penultiniate.³ Plautus and
Terence therefore allowed, under certain restrictions, substitu-
tions for the metrical basis in every foot os a verse but the last,
and reckoned a verse by feet instead of by double-feet: in
other words they did not observe the dipodic law.

(b) Accordingly the Greek trimeter acatalectic⁴ (three-
measure complete) became the Latin senarius (six-foot) 3 the
Greek tetrameter catalectic ⁴ (four-measure incomplete) the Latin

¹ Hence its Greek name.
² The Augustan poets strictly observed the laws of Greek quantitative

prosody, and therefore produced artificial verse which was at variance with

the laws of Latin pronunciation. See Introd. 7, p. 35.
³ As it is, words frequently occur in Plautus and Terence bearing ictus

on the final syllable : the explanation is that certain word-groups (e. g.
uolupta's mea) were pronounced as a single word, and bore stress accordingly.

See Introd. 7, pp. 38-40.
⁴ catalectic literally means ‘ceasing’, acatalectic ‘not ceasing'. A

catalectic line stops short, so to speak‚ before it is metrically complete:
e. g. in the trochaic line

up and ι ᾱόψη the ι City ι Road
the last foot stops short after the first syllable; both that soot and the ·
whole line are catalectic. Contrast an acatalectic trochaic line such as
Berried Ι brake and Ι reedy Ι island-N

In English poetry catalectic feet are very common, not only at the end of
a verse, but also within it: contrast the anapaestic verse

I’m goling out Ι with the tide, Ι lad3 Ι you’ll dig Ι me a numlble grave
(where the fourth foot is catalectic) with the acatalectie
Andflysossoyo-Iigelg will break Ι as you try Ι to speak Ι of the glorlious
