falling under this head are merely special cases of A. (a) or

(b) before an initial consonant, in disyllables with the first
syllable long. This occurs chiefly in experimental metres, the
slurred syllable coming between 'two long syllables both bearing
accent and one ictus, e. g. (bacchiacs)- 753 lco'c 121527' fdcto est,

st‘quis, if right, must be scanned as a pyrrhic 3 but see note
ad loc. The rule that the fourth foot of an Iambic Octonarius,
when followed by diaeresis, must be pure (Introd. 6. II. C. c)
makes it probable that in 999 we should scan (Jufiftrllis me‘, and
even extend the licence to include polysyllables‚ so as to scau

(c) before an initial vowel. This occurs only when a
participle in -us (vs) or an adjective in —us (-os) or -is is
followed by es or est, and is probably due to the sragmentary
pronunciation of the auxiliary or copula. (Possibly molestu’s‚
surruptast, &e should be written molestus, surruptus'l, διε.)
That the determining cause was pronunciation and not metre

is evident from the fact that the final syllable thus formed by
coalescence sometimes bears the metrical ictus. A few instances
only need be given :
