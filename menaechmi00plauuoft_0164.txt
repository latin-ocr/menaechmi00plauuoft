574. clientes (= cluentes those who listen—and do not speak)
were manumitted slaves, protected aliens, descendants of these two
classes, and others, who attached themselves to some rich man as
· patronum cf. the mediaeval baron’s retainers. To have a large
number of clientes conferred social distinction. Plautus frequently,
as here, introduces allusions to Roman institutions and customs3
the framework is Greek, the details Roman (e. g. 451-9). Cf.
Shakespeare's treatment of classical and other legends (e.g. the
‘ nine men's morris ‘ and the Masque in M.-N. D.).

575. Construction: magis quaeritur quoius modi res (clientum)
clueat quam (quoius modi) clientum fides (clueat).

577. quffis modi clueat, ‘in what estimation it is held’:
clueo (like the cognate Gk. κλύω) originally meaning ‘ hear ', acquires
the sense ‘hear oneself called, be named, be reputed’; cf. 854;
T rin. 312 qui animum uz'nczmt . . . semper probiores cluent. So
audio in classical poetry : Hor. Epp. i. 7. 37 rexque paterque Audisti
coram. For the sentiment cf. Juv. iii. 140 Protinus ad censum, de
moribus ultima fiet Quaestio. .

578. nequam habetur (sc. cliens) forms the apodosis. Scan
.ςῖ c‘st (see Introd. 7. IV. A. a. ii, p. 51).

579. diues: substantival.

580. qui- = z'i (clientes) quz. Scan qui m e legle's (cretics); so
Sch. Metr.; but if the line is taken as a bacchiac with an extra
syllable prefixed (anacrusis), the word- accent coincides with the
rhythm: qui Ι nec leges Ι nec aequo-m, &a

aequom bonum: asyndeton 1s common in O. Lat„ especially
in legal and alliterative phrases3 e. g. Rud. 839 uz zazoleizti3a zbid.
882 070 opsecro,

581. sollicitos . . .habent, ‘keep them in a state of worry'3
not mere periphrasis. The explanation follows.

582. datum (sc. id esse), ‘paid' (i. e. to themselves).

584. rem: wealth.

584³. Most edd. read mens est in Ι querelis (bacchiac). Preads
in quo zre Lis ubz, &c., i. e. E of eis, 585, has been changed to L, and
the last syllable of querelis omitted (haplography).

585. ubi dicitur dies, ‘when they are cited to appear in
court’ .

simul patronis: under the early Republic a cliens could not
plead in person, but was represented by his patronus in legal pro-
ceedings. See Willems, Le Droit Publz‘que Romaiu pp. 10-14, and
cf. Hor. Eppii. 1. 104. *R

586. quippe qui . . . loquimur, ‘who‚ if you please, plead in
their defence ’ 3 sarcastic use of quippe qui with indic.; cf. Epid. 618
ST. habe bonum animum. ΕΡ. quippe ego quoi libertas in mundo
sitast ; Pseud. 1274 a. Brix, following P. reads quippe qui pro illis
loquantur quae (mali) malefecerint (trochaic: Vahlen inserts mali) ;
but quippe qui final is a doubtful usage.
